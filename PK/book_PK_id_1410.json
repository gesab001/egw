    "word": "Those who are true to God will be menaced, denounced, proscribed. They will be \"betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends,\" even unto death. Luke 21:16. Their only hope is in the mercy of God; their only defense will be prayer. As Joshua pleaded before the Angel, so the remnant church, with brokenness of heart and unfaltering faith, will plead for pardon and deliverance through Jesus, their Advocate. They are fully conscious of the sinfulness of their lives, they see their weakness and unworthiness; and they are ready to despair.",
