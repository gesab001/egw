{"word": "The visit of the ambassadors to Hezekiah was a test of his gratitude and devotion. The record says, \"Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that He might know all that was in his heart.\" 2 Chronicles 32:31. Had Hezekiah improved the opportunity given him to bear witness to the power, the goodness, the compassion, of the God of Israel, the report of the ambassadors would have been as light piercing darkness. But he magnified himself above the Lord of hosts. He \"rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up.\" Verse 25.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 346}
