{"word": "God had also instructed through Moses: \"If thou lend money to any of My people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer.\" \"Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon usury.\" Exodus 22:25; Deuteronomy 23:19. Again He had said, \"If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother: but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.\" \"For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.\" Deuteronomy 15:7, 8, 11.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 647}
