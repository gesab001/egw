    "word": "This failure to fulfill the divine purpose was very apparent in Malachi's day. Sternly the Lord's messenger dealt with the evils that were robbing Israel of temporal prosperity and spiritual power. In his rebuke against transgressors the prophet spared neither priests nor people. \"The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel\" through Malachi was that the lessons of the past be not forgotten and that the covenant made by Jehovah with the house of Israel be kept with fidelity. Only by heartfelt repentance could the blessing of God be realized. \"I pray you,\" the prophet pleaded, \"beseech God that He will be gracious unto us.\" Malachi 1:1, 9.",
