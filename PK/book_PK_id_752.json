{"word": "In beholding his God, the prophet, like Saul of Tarsus at the gate of Damascus, had not only been given a view of his own unworthiness; there had come to his humbled heart the assurance of forgiveness, full and free; and he had arisen a changed man. He had seen his Lord. He had caught a glimpse of the loveliness of the divine character. He could testify of the transformation wrought through beholding Infinite Love. Henceforth he was inspired with longing desire to see erring Israel set free from the burden and penalty of sin. \"Why should ye be stricken any more?\" the prophet inquired. \"Come now, and let us reason together, \n                                                                           315\nsaith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\" \"Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well.\" Isaiah 1:5, 18, 16, 17.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 314}
