{"word": "In the youthful Jeremiah, God saw one who would be true to his trust and who would stand for the right against great opposition. In childhood he had proved faithful; and now he was to endure hardness, as a good soldier of the cross. \"Say not, I am a child,\" the Lord bade His chosen messenger; \"for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not \n                                                                           408\nafraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee.\" \"Gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them. For, behold, I have made thee this day a defensed city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.\" Verses 7, 8, 17-19.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 407}
