    "word": "In this age of the world, when Satan is seeking, through manifold agencies, to blind the eyes of men and women to the binding claims of the law of God, there is need of men who can cause many to \"tremble at the commandment of our God.\" Ezra 10:3. There is need of true reformers, who will point transgressors to the great Lawgiver and teach them that \"the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\" Psalm 19:7. There is need of men mighty in the Scriptures, men whose every word and act exalts the statutes of Jehovah, men who seek to strengthen faith. Teachers are needed, oh, so much, who will inspire hearts with reverence and love for the Scriptures.",
