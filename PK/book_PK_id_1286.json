{"word": "Chap. 44 - In the Lions' Den\n\n     When Darius the Median took the throne formerly occupied by the Babylonian rulers, he at once proceeded to reorganize the government. He \"set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes; . . . and over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage. Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 539}
