    "word": "The prophet's words, instead of leading to confession and repentance, aroused the anger of those high in authority, and as a consequence Jeremiah was deprived of his liberty. Imprisoned, and placed in the stocks, the prophet nevertheless continued to speak the messages of Heaven to those who stood by. His voice could not be silenced by persecution. The word of truth, he declared, \"was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.\" Jeremiah 20:9.",
