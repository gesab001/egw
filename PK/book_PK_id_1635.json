    "word": "Satan, by means of his success in turning man aside from the path of obedience, became \"the god of this world.\" 2 Corinthians 4:4. The dominion that once was Adam's passed to the usurper. But the Son of God proposed to come to this earth to pay the penalty of sin, and thus not only redeem man, but recover the dominion forfeited. It is of this restoration that Micah prophesied when he said, \"O Tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto Thee shall it come, even the first dominion.\" Micah 4:8. The apostle Paul has referred to it as \"the redemption of the purchased possession.\" Ephesians 1:14. And the psalmist had in mind the same final restoration of man's original inheritance when he declared, \"The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.\" Psalm 37:29.",
