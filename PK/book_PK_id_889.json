    "word": "Such was the prospect that greeted Isaiah when he was called to the prophetic mission; yet he was not discouraged, for ringing in his ears was the triumphal chorus of the angels surrounding the throne of God, \"The whole earth is full of His glory.\" Isaiah 6:3. And his faith was strengthened by visions of glorious conquests by the church of God, when \"the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\" Isaiah 11:9. \"The face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations,\" was finally to be destroyed. Isaiah 25:7. The Spirit of God was to be poured out upon all flesh. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness were to be numbered among the Israel of God. \"They shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the watercourses,\" said the prophet. \"One shall say, I am the Lord's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel.\" Isaiah 44:4, 5.",
