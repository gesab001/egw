    "word": "Among those who had hoped for a permanent spiritual revival as the result of the reformation under Josiah was Jeremiah, called of God to the prophetic office while still a youth, in the thirteenth year of Josiah's reign. A member of the Levitical priesthood, Jeremiah had been trained from childhood for holy service. In those happy years of preparation he little realized that he had been ordained from birth to be \"a prophet unto the nations;\" and when the divine call came, he was overwhelmed with a sense of his unworthiness. \"Ah, Lord God!\" he exclaimed, \"behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.\" Jeremiah 1:5, 6.",
