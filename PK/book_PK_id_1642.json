{"word": "From the day the Lord declared to the serpent in Eden, \"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed\" (Genesis 3:15), Satan has known that he can never hold absolute sway over the inhabitants of this world. When Adam and his sons began to offer the ceremonial sacrifices ordained by God as a type of the coming Redeemer, Satan discerned in these a symbol of communion between earth and heaven. During the long centuries that have followed, it has been his constant effort to intercept this communion. Untiringly has he sought to misrepresent God and to misinterpret the rites pointing to the Saviour, and with a great majority of the members of the human family he has been successful.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 685}
