{"word": "In his own strength, man cannot meet the charges of the enemy. In sin-stained garments, confessing his guilt, he stands before God. But Jesus, our Advocate, presents an effectual plea in behalf of all who by repentance and faith have committed the keeping of their souls to Him. He pleads their cause, and by the mighty arguments of Calvary, vanquishes their accuser. His perfect obedience to God's law has given Him all power in heaven and in earth, and He claims from His Father mercy and reconciliation for guilty man. To the accuser of His people He declares: \n                                                                           587\n\"The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan. These are the purchase of My blood, brands plucked from the burning.\" And to those who rely on Him in faith, He gives the assurance, \"Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.\" Zechariah 3:4.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 586}
