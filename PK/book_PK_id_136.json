{"word": "Jesus, the divine Master, ever exalted the name of His heavenly Father. He taught His disciples to pray, \"Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.\" Matthew 6:9, A.R.V. And they were not to forget to acknowledge, \"Thine is . . . the glory.\" Verse 13. So careful was the great Healer to direct attention from Himself to the Source of His power, that the wondering multitude, \"when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see,\" did not glorify Him, but \"glorified the God of Israel.\" Matthew 15:31. In the wonderful prayer that Christ offered just before His crucifixion, He declared, \"I have glorified Thee on the earth.\" \"Glorify Thy Son,\" He pleaded, \"that Thy Son also may glorify Thee.\" \"O righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee: but I have known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast sent Me. And I have declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them.\" John 17:4, 1, 25, 26.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 69}
