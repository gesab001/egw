    "word": "Elisha was a man of mild and kindly spirit; but that he could also be stern is shown by his course when, on the way to Bethel, he was mocked by ungodly youth who had come out of the city. These youth had heard of Elijah's ascension, and they made this solemn event the subject of their jeers, saying to Elisha, \"Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.\" At the sound of their mocking words the prophet turned back, and under the inspiration of the Almighty he pronounced a curse upon them. The awful judgment that followed was of God. \"There came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two\" of them. 2 Kings 2:23, 24.",
