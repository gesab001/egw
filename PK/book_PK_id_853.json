{"word": "\"O Lord God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims,\" Hezekiah pleaded, \"Thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth. Lord, bow down Thine ear, and hear: open, Lord, Thine eyes, and see: and hear the words \n                                                                           356\nof Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God. Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands, and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. Now therefore, O Lord our God, I beseech Thee, save Thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the Lord God, even Thou only.\" 2 Kings 19:15-19. \n\n\n     \"Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, \n      Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; \n      Thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. \n      Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up Thy \n           strength, \n      And come and save us. \n      Turn us again, O God, \n      And cause Thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. \n\n\n     \"O Lord God of hosts, \n      How long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy \n           people? \n      Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; \n      And givest them tears to drink in great measure. \n      Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors: \n      And our enemies laugh among themselves. \n      Turn us again, O God of hosts, \n      And cause Thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. \n\n\n     \"Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: \n      Thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. \n      Thou preparedst room before it, \n      And didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. \n      The hills were covered with the shadow of it, \n      And the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. \n      She sent out her boughs unto the sea, \n      And her branches unto the river. \n                                                                           359\n\n     \"Why hast Thou then broken down her hedges, \n      So that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? \n      The boar out of the wood doth waste it, \n      And the wild beast of the field doth devour it. \n      Return, we beseech Thee, O God of hosts: \n      Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; \n      And the vineyard which Thy right hand hath planted, \n      And the branch that Thou madest strong for Thyself. . . . \n\n\n     \"Quicken us, and we will call upon Thy name. \n      Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, \n      Cause Thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.\" Psalm 80.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 355}
