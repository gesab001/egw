    "word": "But though weary of life, Job was not allowed to die. To him were pointed out the possibilities of the future, and there was given him the message of hope: \n\n\n          \"Thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear: \n           Because thou shalt forget thy misery, \n           And remember it as waters that pass away: \n            And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; \n            Thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. \n            And thou shalt be secure, \n            Because there is hope. . . . \n            Thou shalt lie down, \n            And none shall make thee afraid; \n            Yea, many shall make suit unto thee. \n            But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, \n            And they shall not escape, \n            And their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.\" \n                                                   Job 11:15-20.",
