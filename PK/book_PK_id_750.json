The missionary activities of the church of God on earth are bearing rich fruitage, and soon the gospel message will have been proclaimed to all nations. \"To the praise of the glory of His grace,\" men and women from every kindred, tongue, and people are being made \"accepted in the Beloved,\" \"that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.\" Ephesians 1:6; 2:7. \"Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. And blessed be His glorious name forever: and let the whole earth be filled with His glory.\" Psalm 72:18, 19.",
