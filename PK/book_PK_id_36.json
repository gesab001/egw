{"word": "The God whom we serve is no respecter of persons. He who gave to Solomon the spirit of wise discernment is willing to impart the same blessing to His children today. \"If any of you lack wisdom,\" His word declares, \"let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" James 1:5. When a burden bearer desires wisdom more than he desires wealth, power, or fame, he will not be disappointed. Such a one will learn from the Great Teacher not only what to do, but how to do it in a way that will meet with the divine approval.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 31}
