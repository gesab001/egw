{"word": "Chap. 23 - The Assyrian Captivity\n\n     The closing years of the ill-fated kingdom of Israel were marked with violence and bloodshed such as had never been witnessed even in the worst periods of strife and unrest under the house of Ahab. For two centuries and more the rulers of the ten tribes had been sowing the wind; now they were reaping the whirlwind. King after king was assassinated to make way for others ambitious to rule. \"They have set up kings,\" the Lord declared of these godless usurpers, \"but not by Me: they have made princes, and I knew it not.\" Hosea 8:4. Every principle of justice was set aside; those who should have stood before the nations of earth as the depositaries of divine grace, \"dealt treacherously against the Lord\" and with one another. Hosea 5:7.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 279}
