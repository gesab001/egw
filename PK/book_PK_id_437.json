As he approached the city, the prophet Jehu met him with the reproof: \"Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord. Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.\" 2 Chronicles 19:2,  3.",
