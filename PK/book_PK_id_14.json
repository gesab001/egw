{"word": "But ancient Israel did not fulfill God's purpose. The Lord declared, \"I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto Me?\" \"Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself.\" \"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt Me and My vineyard. What could have been done more to My vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I \n                                                                           20\nlooked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: and I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. For . . . He looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.\" Jeremiah 2:21; Hosea 10:1; Isaiah 5:3-7.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 19}
