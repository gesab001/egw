{"word": "In another prophetic message, given \"in the year that King Ahaz died,\" the prophet had declared: \"The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: that I will break the Assyrian in My land, and upon My mountains tread him underfoot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders. This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?\" Isaiah 14:28, 24-27.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 350}
