He saw that it was not zeal for kingly glory and honor, but jealousy against Daniel, that had led to the proposal for a royal decree. \"Sore displeased with himself\" for his part in the evil that had been wrought, he \"labored till the going down of the sun\" to deliver his friend. The princes, anticipating this effort on the part of the king, came to him with the words, \"Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.\" The decree, though rashly made, was unalterable and must be carried into effect.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 543}
