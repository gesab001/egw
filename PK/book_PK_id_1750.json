    "word": "The voice of the Son of God is heard calling forth the sleeping saints, and as the prophet beholds them coming from the prison house of death, he exclaims, \"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.\" \n\n\n          \"Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, \n           And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. \n           Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, \n           And the tongue of the dumb sing.\" \n                             Isaiah 26:19; 35:5, 6.",
