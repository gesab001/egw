{"word": "\"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,\" he wrote, \"and the man that getteth understanding. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: and all things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.\" Proverbs 3:13-18.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 34}
