    "word": "As the prophet beholds the redeemed dwelling in the City of God, free from sin and from all marks of the curse, in rapture he exclaims, \"Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her.\"           \"Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, \n             Wasting nor destruction within thy borders; \n           But thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, \n            And thy gates Praise. \n\n\n          \"The sun shall be no more thy light by day; \n           Neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: \n           But the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, \n            And thy God thy glory. \n\n\n          \"Thy sun shall no more go down; \n           Neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: \n           For the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, \n             And the days of thy mourning shall be ended. \n\n\n          \"Thy people also shall be all righteous: \n           They shall inherit the land forever, \n             The branch of My planting, \n           The work of My hands, \n           That I may be glorified.\" \n                         Isaiah 66:10; 60:18-21.",
