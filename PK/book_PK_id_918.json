To him was given the divine assurance, \"My grace is sufficient for thee: for My strength is made perfect in weakness.\" In gratitude and confidence the tried servant of God responded: \"Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.\" 2 Corinthians 12:9, 10.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 387}
