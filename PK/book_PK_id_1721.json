{"word": "This is the work which the prophet Isaiah describes when he says: \"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward.\" Isaiah 58:7, 8.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 718}
