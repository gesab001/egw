{"word": "Those who, standing in the forefront of the conflict, are impelled by the Holy Spirit to do a special work, will frequently feel a reaction when the pressure is removed. Despondency may shake the most heroic faith and weaken the most steadfast will. But God understands, and He still pities and loves. He reads the motives and the purposes of the heart.

Heaven will not fail them in their day of adversity. \n                                                                           175\nNothing is apparently more helpless, yet really more invincible, than the soul that feels its nothingness and relies wholly on God.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 174}
