{"word": "We were all debtors to divine justice, but we had nothing with which to pay the debt. Then the Son of God, who pitied us, paid the price of our redemption. He became poor that through His poverty we might be rich. By deeds of liberality toward His poor we may prove the sincerity of our gratitude for the mercy extended to us. \"Let us do good unto all men,\" the apostle Paul enjoins, \"especially unto them who are of the household of faith.\" Galatians 6:10. And his words accord with those of the Saviour: \"Ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good.\" \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\" Mark 14:7; Matthew 7:12.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 652}
