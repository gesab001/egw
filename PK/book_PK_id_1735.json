    "word": "Many were the messages of comfort given the church by the prophets of old. \"Comfort ye, comfort ye My people\" (Isaiah 40:1), was Isaiah's commission from God; and with the commission were given wonderful visions that have been the believers' hope and joy through all the centuries that have followed. Despised of men, persecuted, forsaken, God's children in every age have nevertheless been sustained by His sure promises. By faith they have looked forward to the time when He will fulfill to His church the assurance, \"I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.\" Isaiah 60:15.",
