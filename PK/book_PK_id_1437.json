    "word": "\"Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north,\" was the message given the scattered tribes of Israel who had become settled in many lands far from their former home. \"I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the Lord. Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. For thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath He sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye. For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me.\" Zechariah 2:6-9.",
