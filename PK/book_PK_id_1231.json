{"word": "\"My lord,\" Daniel answered, \"the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.\" The prophet realized that upon him God had laid the solemn duty of revealing to Nebuchadnezzar the judgment that was about to fall upon him because of his pride and arrogance. Daniel must interpret the dream in language the king could understand; and although its dreadful import had made him hesitate in dumb amazement, yet he must state the truth, whatever the consequences to himself.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 517}
