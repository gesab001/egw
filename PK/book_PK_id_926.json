{"word": "Josiah was deeply stirred as he heard read for the first time the exhortations and warnings recorded in this ancient manuscript. Never before had he realized so fully the plainness with which God had set before Israel \"life and death, blessing and cursing\" (Deuteronomy 30:19): and how repeatedly they had been urged to choose the way of life, that they might become a praise in the earth, a blessing to all nations. \"Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid,\" Israel had been exhorted through Moses; \"for the Lord thy God. He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, not forsake thee.\" Deuteronomy 31:6.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 393}
