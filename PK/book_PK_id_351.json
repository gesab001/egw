    "word": "Faith such as this is needed in the world today--faith that will lay hold on the promises of God's word and refuse to let go until Heaven hears. Faith such as this connects us closely with Heaven, and brings us strength for coping with the powers of darkness. Through faith God's children have \"subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.\" Hebrews 11:33, 34. And through faith we today are to reach the heights of God's purpose for us. \"If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.\" Mark 9:23.",
