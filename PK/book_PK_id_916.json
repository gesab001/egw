    "word": "This was not Habakkuk's only experience in the exercise of strong faith. On one occasion, when meditating concerning the future, he said, \"I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what He will say unto me.\" Graciously the Lord answered him: \"Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry. Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.\" Habakkuk 2:1-4.",
