{"word": "Released from prison by the Babylonian officers, the prophet chose to cast in his lot with the feeble remnant, certain \"poor of the land\" left by the Chaldeans to be \"vinedressers and husbandmen.\" Over these the Babylonians set Gedaliah as governor. Only a few months passed before the newly appointed governor was treacherously slain. The poor people, after passing through many trials, were finally persuaded by their leaders to take refuge in the land of Egypt. Against this move, Jeremiah lifted his voice in protest. \"Go ye not into Egypt,\" he pleaded. But the inspired counsel was not heeded, and \"all the remnant of Judah, . . . even men, and women, and children,\" took flight into Egypt. \"They obeyed not the voice of the Lord: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.\" Jeremiah 43:5-7.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 460}
