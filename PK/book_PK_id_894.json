{"word": "Looking on still farther through the ages, the prophet beheld the literal fulfillment of these glorious promises. He saw the bearers of the glad tidings of salvation going to the ends of the earth, to every kindred and people. He heard the Lord saying of the gospel church, \"Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream;\" and he heard the commission, \"Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles.\" Isaiah 66:12; 54:2, 3.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 374}
