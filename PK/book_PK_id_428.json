    "word": "Throughout the kingdom the people were in need of instruction in the law of God. In an understanding of this law lay their safety; by conforming their lives to its requirements they would become loyal both to God and to man. Knowing this, Jehoshaphat took steps to ensure to his people thorough instruction in the Holy Scriptures. The princes in charge of the different portions of his realm were directed to arrange for the faithful ministry of teaching priests. By royal appointment these instructors, working under the direct supervision of the princes, \"went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.\" 2 Chronicles 17:7-9. And as many endeavored to understand God's requirements and to put away sin, a revival was effected.",
