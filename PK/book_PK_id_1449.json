{"word": "The trying experiences that came to God's people in the days of Esther were not peculiar to that age alone. The revelator, looking down the ages to the close of time, has declared, \"The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\" Revelation 12:17.

Even now preparations are being made for this last great conflict.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 605}
