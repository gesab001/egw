{"word": "During the greater part of this time of apostasy in Israel, Asa was ruling in the kingdom of Judah. For many years \"Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God: for he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: and commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun [margin] images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.\" 2 Chronicles 14:2-5.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 110}
