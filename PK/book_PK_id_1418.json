{"word": "As the people of God afflict their souls before Him, pleading for purity of heart, the command is given, \"Take away the filthy garments,\" and the encouraging words are spoken, \"Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.\" Zechariah 3:4. The spotless robe of Christ's righteousness is placed upon the tried, tempted, faithful children of God. The despised remnant are clothed in glorious apparel, nevermore to be defiled by the corruptions of the world. Their names are retained in the Lamb's book of life, enrolled among the faithful of all ages. They have resisted the wiles of the deceiver; they have not been turned from their loyalty by the dragon's roar. Now they are eternally secure from the tempter's devices. Their sins are transferred to the originator of sin. A \"fair miter\" is set upon their heads.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 591}
