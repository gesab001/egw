{"word": "\"In that day\" \"the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, . . . shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.\" Isaiah 10:20. From \"every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people\" there will be some who will gladly respond to the message, \"Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment \n                                                                           300\nis come.\" They will turn from every idol that binds them to earth, and will \"worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\" They will free themselves from every entanglement and will stand before the world as monuments of God's mercy. Obedient to the divine requirements, they will be recognized by angels and by men as those that have kept \"the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\" Revelation 14:6, 7, 12.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 299}
