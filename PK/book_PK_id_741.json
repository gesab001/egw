The assurance of the heavenly visitant to Isaiah was: \n\n\n          \"In it shall be a tenth, \n           And it shall return, and shall be eaten: \n                                                                           310\n\n           As a teil tree, and as an oak, \n           Whose substance is in them, when they cast \n                their leaves: \n           So the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.\" \n                                              Verse 13.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 309}
