{"word": "\"Doest thou well to be angry?\" the Lord inquired. \"So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. And the Lord God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.\" Verses 3-6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 272}
