    "word": "Because Israel had been chosen to preserve the knowledge of God in the earth, they had ever been the special objects of Satan's enmity; he was determined to cause their destruction.

Ensnared by his temptations, they had transgressed the law of God and had been left to become the prey of their enemies.",
