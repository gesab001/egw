And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds \n                                                                           241\nhis lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not. So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof. But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 240}
