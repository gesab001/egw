    "word": "\"Behold,\" says the Scripture, \"the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee.\" Verse 2. Christ, the outshining of the Father's glory, came to the world as its light. He came to represent God to men, and of Him it is written that He was anointed \"with the Holy Ghost and with power,\" and \"went about doing good.\" Acts 10:38. In the synagogue at Nazareth He said, \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\" Luke 4:18, 19. This was the work He commissioned His disciples to do. \"Ye are the light of the world,\" He said. \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Matthew 5:14, 16.",
