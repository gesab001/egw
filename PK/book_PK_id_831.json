    "word": "In a time of grave national peril, when the hosts of Assyria were invading the land of Judah and it seemed as if nothing could save Jerusalem from utter destruction, Hezekiah rallied the forces of his realm to resist with unfailing courage their heathen oppressors and to trust in the power of Jehovah to deliver. \"Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him,\" Hezekiah exhorted the men of Judah; \"for there be more with us than with him: with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles.\" 2 Chronicles 32:7, 8.",
