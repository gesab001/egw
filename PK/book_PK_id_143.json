    "word": "In striking contrast to the course pursued by Solomon was the course followed by Christ when He was on this earth. The Saviour, though possessing \"all power,\" never used this power for self-aggrandizement. No dream of earthly conquest, of worldly greatness, marred the perfection of His service for mankind. \"Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests,\" He said, \"but the Son of man hath not where to lay His head.\" Matthew 8:20. Those who, in response to the call of the hour, have entered the service of the Master Worker, may well study His methods. He took advantage of the opportunities to be found along the great thoroughfares of travel.",
