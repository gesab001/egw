{"word": "\"The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,\" declares Isaiah of the day of God's vengeance, \"and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. And the idols He shall utterly abolish. . . . In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty, when He ariseth to shake terribly the earth.\" Isaiah 2:17-21.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 727}
