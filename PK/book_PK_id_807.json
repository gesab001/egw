And in every work that he began, . . . he did it with all his heart, and prospered.\" \"He trusted in the Lord God of Israel, . . . and departed not from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses. And the Lord was with him; and he prospered.\" Verses 20, 21; 2 Kings 18:5-7.",
