    "word": "The writings of Moses were taught by Joshua to all Israel. \"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.\" Joshua 8:35. This was in harmony with the express command of Jehovah providing for a public rehearsal of the words of the book of the law every seven years, during the Feast of Tabernacles. \"Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates,\" the spiritual leaders of Israel had been instructed, \"that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this law: and that their children, which have not known anything, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.\" Deuteronomy 31:12, 13.",
