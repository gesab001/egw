    "word": "At the time of the final overthrow of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, many had escaped the horrors of the long siege, only to perish by the sword. Of those who still remained, some, notably the chief of the priests and officers and the princes of the realm, were taken to Babylon and there executed as traitors. Others were carried captive, to live in servitude to Nebuchadnezzar and to his sons \"until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah.\" Verses 20, 21.",
