{"word": "Even these words were received with mocking derision. \"The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth,\" declared the impenitent. But through Ezekiel this denial of the sure word of prophecy was sternly rebuked. \"Tell them,\" the Lord declared, \"I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision. For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel. For I am the Lord: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 450}
