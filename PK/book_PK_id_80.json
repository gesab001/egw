    "word": "The humility of Solomon at the time he began to bear the burdens of state, when he acknowledged before God, \"I am but a little child\" (1 Kings 3:7), his marked love of God, his profound reverence for things divine, his distrust of self, and his exaltation of the infinite Creator of all--all these traits of character, so worthy of emulation, were revealed during the services connected with the completion of the temple, when during his dedicatory prayer he knelt in the humble position of a petitioner. Christ's followers today should guard against the tendency to lose the spirit of reverence and godly fear. The Scriptures teach men how they should approach their Maker--with humility and awe, through faith in a divine Mediator. The psalmist has declared: \n\n\n          \"The Lord is a great God, \n           And a great King above all gods. . . . \n           O come, let us worship and bow down: \n           Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\" \n                                    Psalm 95:3-6.",
