    "word": "As the seed sown produces a harvest, and this in turn is sown, the harvest is multiplied. In our relation to others, this law holds true. Every act, every word, is a seed that will bear fruit. Every deed of thoughtful kindness, of obedience, of self-denial, will reproduce itself in others, and through them in still others. So every act of envy, malice, or dissension is a seed that will spring up in a \"root of bitterness\" whereby many shall be defiled. Hebrews 12:15. And how much larger number will the \"many\" poison! Thus the sowing of good and evil goes on for time and for eternity.",
