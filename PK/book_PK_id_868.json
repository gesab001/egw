    "word": "The prophet Nahum, in his arraignment of the evildoers in Nineveh, exclaimed: \n\n\n     \"Woe to the bloody city! \n      It is all full of lies and robbery; \n      The prey departeth not; \n\n\n     \"The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling \n           of the wheels, \n      And of the prancing horses, and of the jumping \n           chariots.      The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword \n           and the glittering spear: \n     And there is a multitude of slain. . . . \n\n\n     \"Behold, I am against thee, \n      Saith the Lord of hosts.\" \n                        Nahum 3:1-5.",
