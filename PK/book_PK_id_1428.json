    "word": "Often men are tempted to falter before the perplexities and obstacles that confront them. But if they will hold the beginning of their confidence steadfast unto the end, God will make the way clear. Success will come to them as  they struggle against difficulties. Before the intrepid spirit and unwavering faith of a Zerubbabel, great mountains of  difficulty will become a plain; and he whose hands have laid the foundation, even \"his hands shall also finish it.\" \"He shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.\" Zechariah 4:9, 7.",
