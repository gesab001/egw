What was their astonishment when, entering the camp, they found \"no man there.\" With none to molest or forbid, \"they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it. Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is \n                                                                           259\na day of good tidings, and we hold our peace.\" Quickly they returned to the city with the glad news.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 258}
