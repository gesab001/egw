{"word": "To us, as to Peter, the word is spoken, \"Satan hath desired \n                                                                           176\nto have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" Luke 22:31, 32. Christ will never abandon those for whom He has died. We may leave Him and be overwhelmed with temptation, but Christ can never turn from one for whom He has paid the ransom of His own life. Could our spiritual vision be quickened, we should see souls bowed under oppression and burdened with grief, pressed as a cart beneath sheaves, and ready to die in discouragement. We should see angels flying quickly to the aid of these tempted ones, forcing back the hosts of evil that encompass them, and placing their feet on the sure foundation. The battles waging between the two armies are as real as those fought by the armies of this world, and on the issue of the spiritual conflict eternal destinies depend.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 175}
