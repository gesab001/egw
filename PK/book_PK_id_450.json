{"word": "With confidence Jehoshaphat could say to the Lord, \"Our eyes are upon thee.\" For years he had taught the people to trust in the One who in past ages had so often interposed to save His chosen ones from utter destruction; and now, when the kingdom was in peril, Jehoshaphat did not stand alone; \"all Judah stood before the Lord, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.\" Verse 13. Unitedly they fasted and prayed; unitedly they besought the Lord to put their enemies to confusion, that the name of Jehovah might be glorified. \n\n\n          \"Keep not Thou silence, O God: \n           Hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God. \n           For, lo, Thine enemies make a tumult: \n           And they that hate Thee have lifted up the head. \n           They have taken crafty counsel against Thy people, \n           And consulted against Thy hidden ones. \n           They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from \n               being a nation; \n           That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. \n           For they have consulted together with one consent: \n           They are confederate against Thee: \n           The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; \n           Of Moab, and the Hagarenes; \n           Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek. . . . \n           Do unto them as unto the Midianites; \n           As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: . . . \n           Let them be confounded and troubled forever; \n           Yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: \n           That men may know that Thou, whose name alone is \n               Jehovah, \n           Art the Most High over all the earth.\" \n                                  Psalm 83. \n                                                                           201", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 200}
