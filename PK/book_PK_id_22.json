{"word": "Chap. 1 - Solomon\n\n     In the reign of David and Solomon, Israel became strong among the nations and had many opportunities to wield a mighty influence in behalf of truth and the right. The name of Jehovah was exalted and held in honor, and the purpose for which the Israelites had been established in the Land of Promise bade fair of meeting with fulfillment.

Conversions took place, and the church of God on earth was enlarged and prospered.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 25}
