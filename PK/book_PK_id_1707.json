{"word": "Solemnly and regretfully Christ asked: \"Did ye never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\" Matthew 21:34-44.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 712}
