{"word": "Daniel's first act was to thank God for the revelation given him. \"Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,\" he exclaimed; \"for wisdom and might are His: and He changeth the times and the seasons: He removeth kings, and setteth up kings: He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: He revealeth the deep and secret things: He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him. I thank Thee, and praise Thee, O Thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of Thee: for Thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 494}
