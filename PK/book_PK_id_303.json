    "word": "Greatly terrified, Obadiah exclaimed, \"What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?\" To take such a message as this to Ahab was to court certain death. \"As the Lord thy God liveth,\" he explained to the prophet, \"there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me.\"",
