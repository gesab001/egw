{"word": "In the visions of the prophet, those who have triumphed over sin and the grave are now seen happy in the presence of their Maker, talking freely with Him as man talked with God in the beginning. \"Be ye glad,\" the Lord bids them, \"and rejoice forever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.\" \"The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.\" \n\n\n          \"In the wilderness shall waters break out, \n           And streams in the desert. \n           And the parched ground shall become a pool, \n           And the thirsty land springs of water.\" \n\n\n          \"Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, \n           And instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree.\" \n\n\n          \"And an highway shall be there, and a way, \n           And it shall be called The way of holiness; \n           The unclean shall not pass over it; \n           But it shall be for those: \n           The wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 729}
