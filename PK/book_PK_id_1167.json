{"word": "Among those sought for by the officers who were preparing to fulfill the provisions of the royal decree, were Daniel and his friends. When told that according to the decree they also must die, \"with counsel and wisdom\" Daniel inquired of Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, \"Why is the decree so hasty from the king?\" Arioch told him the story of the king's perplexity over his remarkable dream, and of his failure to secure help from those in whom he had hitherto placed fullest confidence. Upon hearing this, Daniel, taking his life in his hands, ventured into the king's presence and begged that time be granted, that he might petition his God to reveal to him the dream and its interpretation.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 493}
