As the Jews departed from God, faith grew dim, and hope well-nigh ceased to illuminate the future. The words of the prophets were uncomprehended by many; and those whose faith should have continued strong were ready to exclaim, \"The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth.\" Ezekiel 12:22. But in heaven's council the hour for the coming of Christ had been determined; and \"when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, . . . to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.\" Galatians 4:4, 5.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 700}
