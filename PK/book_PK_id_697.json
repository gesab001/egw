In judgment the Lord remembered mercy, and at first, when \"Pul the king of Assyria came against the land,\" Menahem, then king of Israel, was not taken captive, but was permitted to remain on the throne as a vassal of the Assyrian realm. \"Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria.\" 2 Kings 15:19, 20. The Assyrians, having humbled the ten tribes, returned for a season to their own land.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 287}
