{"word": "It is by the mighty power of the Infinite One that the elements of nature in earth and sea and sky are kept within bounds. And these elements He uses for the happiness of His creatures. \"His good treasure\" is freely expended \"to give the rain . . . in his season, and to bless all the work\" of man's hands. Deuteronomy 28:12. \n\n\n      \"He sendeth the springs into the valleys, \n        Which run among the hills. \n       They give drink to every beast of the field: \n        The wild asses quench their thirst. \n       By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, \n        Which sing among the branches. . . . \n                                                                           135\n\n     He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, \n      And herb for the service of man: \n     That He may bring forth food out of the earth; \n      And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, \n     And oil to make his face to shine, \n      And bread which strengtheneth man's heart. . . . \n\n\n     \"O Lord, how manifold are Thy works! \n      In wisdom has Thou made them all: \n      The earth is full of Thy riches. \n     So is this great and wide sea, \n     Wherein are things creeping innumerable, \n      Both small and great beasts. . . . \n     These wait all upon Thee; \n     That Thou mayest give them their meat in due season. \n      That Thou givest them they gather: \n\n\n     \"Thou openest Thine hand, \n       They are filled with good.\" \n                          Psalm 104:10-15, 24-28.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 134}
