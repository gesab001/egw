    "word": "But as the hand of affliction was removed, and the nation prospered once more, many forgot their fears and turned again to idolatry. Among these was King Rehoboam himself. Though humbled by the calamity that had befallen him, he failed to make this experience a decisive turning point in his life. Forgetting the lesson that God had endeavored to teach him, he relapsed into the sins that had brought judgments on the nation. After a few inglorious years, during which the king \"did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord,\" \"Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.\" Verses 14, 16.",
