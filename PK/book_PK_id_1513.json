Another question gave the opportunity for which Nehemiah had long waited: \"For what dost thou make request?\" But the man of God did not venture to reply till he had sought direction from One higher than Artaxerxes. He had a sacred trust to fulfill, in which he required help from the king; and he realized that much depended upon his presenting the matter in such a way as to win his approval and enlist his aid. \"I prayed,\" he said, \"to the God of heaven.\" In that brief prayer Nehemiah pressed into the presence of the King of kings and won to his side a power that can turn hearts as the rivers of waters are turned.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 631}
