{"word": "Solomon acknowledged that \"the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart.\" Ecclesiastes 9:3. And again he declared, \"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, \n                                                                           79\nyet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before Him: but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.\" Ecclesiastes 8:11-13.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 78}
