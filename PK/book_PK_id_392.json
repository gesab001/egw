{"word": "Not alone for men in positions of large responsibility is the lesson of Elijah's experience in learning anew how to trust God in the hour of trial. He who was Elijah's strength is strong to uphold every struggling child of His, no matter how weak. Of everyone He expects loyalty, and to everyone He grants power according to the need. In his own strength man is strengthless; but in the might of God he may be strong to overcome evil and to help others to overcome. Satan can never gain advantage of him who makes God his defense. \"Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength.\" Isaiah 45:24.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 175}
