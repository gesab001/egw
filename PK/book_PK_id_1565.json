The Scriptures picture the greed and oppression that will prevail just before Christ's second coming. \"Go to now, ye rich men,\" James writes; \"ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.

Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.\" James 5:1, 3-6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 651}
