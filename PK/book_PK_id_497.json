Jehoram of Israel, Ahaziah of Judah, and Jezebel the queen mother, with \"all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests,\" were slain. \"All the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests\" dwelling at the center of Baal worship near Samaria, were put to the sword. The idolatrous images were broken down and burned, and the temple of Baal was laid in ruins. \"Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.\" 2 Kings 10:11, 19, 28.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 215}
