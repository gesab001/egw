{"word": "In the vision that came to Isaiah in the temple court, he was given a clear view of the character of the God of Israel. \"The high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy,\" had appeared before him in great majesty; yet the prophet was made to understand the compassionate nature of his Lord. He who dwells \"in the high and holy place\" dwells \"with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\" Isaiah 57:15. The angel commissioned to touch Isaiah's lips had brought to him the message, \"Thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.\" Isaiah 6:7.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 314}
