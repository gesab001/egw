{"word": "As we near the close of this world's history, the prophecies recorded by Daniel demand our special attention, as they relate to the very time in which we are living. With them should be linked the teachings of the last book of the New Testament Scriptures. Satan has led many to believe that the prophetic portions of the writings of Daniel and of John the revelator cannot be understood. But the promise is plain that special blessing will accompany the study of these prophecies. \"The wise shall understand\" (verse 10), was spoken of the visions of Daniel that were to be unsealed \n                                                                           548\nin the latter days; and of the revelation that Christ gave to His servant John for the guidance of God's people all through the centuries, the promise is, \"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.\" Revelation 1:3.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 547}
