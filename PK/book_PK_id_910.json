    "word": "Among those whose life experience had been shaped beyond recall by the fatal apostasy of Manasseh, was his own son, who came to the throne at the age of twenty-two. Of King Amon it is written: \"He walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them: and he forsook the Lord God of his fathers\" (2 Kings 21:21, 22); he \"humbled not himself before the Lord, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.\" The wicked king was not permitted to reign long. In the midst of his daring impiety, only two years from the time he ascended the throne, he was slain in the palace by his own servants; and \"the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.\" 2 Chronicles 33:23, 25.",
