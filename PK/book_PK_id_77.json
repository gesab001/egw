{"word": "Had Solomon continued to serve the Lord in humility, his entire reign would have exerted a powerful influence for good over the surrounding nations, nations that had been so favorably impressed by the reign of David his father and by the wise words and the magnificent works of the earlier years of his own reign. Foreseeing the terrible temptations that attend prosperity and worldly honor, God warned Solomon against the evil of apostasy and foretold the awful results of sin. Even the beautiful temple that had just been dedicated, He declared, would become \"a proverb and a byword among all nations\" should the Israelites forsake \"the Lord God of their fathers\" and persist in idolatry. Verses 20, 22.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 47}
