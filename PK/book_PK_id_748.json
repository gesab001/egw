God's glory, His character, His merciful kindness and tender love--that which Moses had pleaded in behalf of Israel--were to be revealed to all mankind.

As surely as God lives and reigns, His glory should be declared \"among the heathen, His wonders among all people.\" Psalm 96:3.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 313}
