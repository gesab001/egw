    "word": "Graciously the Lord responded, \"I have pardoned according to thy word.\" And then He imparted to Moses, in the form of a prophecy, a knowledge of His purpose concerning the final triumph of Israel. \"As truly as I live,\" He declared, \"all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.\" Verses 20, 21. God's glory, His character, His merciful kindness and tender love--that which Moses had pleaded in behalf of Israel--were to be revealed to all mankind. And this promise of Jehovah was made doubly sure; it was confirmed by an oath. As surely as God lives and reigns, His glory should be declared \"among the heathen, His wonders among all people.\" Psalm 96:3.",
