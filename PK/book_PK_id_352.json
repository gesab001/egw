    "word": "Faith is an essential element of prevailing prayer. \"He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.\" \"If we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.\" Hebrews 11:6, 1 John 5:14, 15. With the persevering faith of Jacob, with the unyielding persistence of Elijah, we may present our petitions to the Father, claiming all that He has promised. The honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His word.",
