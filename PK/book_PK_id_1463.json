{"word": "In giving permission to the Israelites to return, Artaxerxes arranged for the restoration of the members of the priesthood to their ancient rites and privileges. \"We certify you,\" he declared, \"that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.\" He also arranged for the appointment of civil officers to govern the people justly in accordance with the Jewish code of laws. \"Thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand,\" he directed, \"set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.\" Verses 24-26.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 611}
