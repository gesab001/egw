O Lord God of Israel, Thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before Thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before Thee because of this.\" Verses 6-15. \n                                                                           622", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 621}
