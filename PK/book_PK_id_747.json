    "word": "It was upon his knowledge of the long-sufferance of Jehovah and of His infinite love and mercy, that Moses based his wonderful plea for the life of Israel when, on the borders of the Promised Land, they refused to advance in obedience to the command of God. At the height of their rebellion the Lord had declared, \"I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them;\" and He had proposed to make of the descendants of Moses \"a greater nation and mightier than they.\" Numbers 14:12.

See verses 17-19.",
