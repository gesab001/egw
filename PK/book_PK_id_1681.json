{"word": "Chap. 59 - \"The House of Israel\"\n\n     In proclaiming the truths of the everlasting gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, God's church on earth today is fulfilling the ancient prophecy, \"Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.\" Isaiah 27:6. The followers of Jesus, in co-operation with heavenly intelligences, are rapidly occupying the waste places of the earth; and, as the result of their labors, an abundant fruitage of precious souls is developing. Today, as never before, the dissemination of Bible truth by means of a consecrated church is bringing to the sons of men the benefits foreshadowed centuries ago in the promise to Abraham and to all Israel,--to God's church on earth in every age,--\"I will bless thee, . . . and thou shalt be a blessing.\" Genesis 12:2.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 703}
