{"word": "Chap. 17 - The Call of Elisha\n\n     God had bidden Elijah anoint another to be prophet in his stead. \"Elisha the son of Shaphat . . . shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room\" (1 Kings 19:16), He had said; and in obedience to the command, Elijah went to find Elisha. As he journeyed northward, how changed was the scene from what it had been only a short while before! Then the ground was parched, the farming districts unworked, for neither dew nor rain had fallen for three and a half years. Now on every hand vegetation was springing up as if to redeem the time of drought and famine.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 217}
