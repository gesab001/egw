One day he was stricken down by the heat, \"and he said unto his father, My head, my head.\" The father bade a lad carry the child to his mother; \"and when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 238}
