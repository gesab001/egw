    "word": "In his efforts to rule wisely, Jehoshaphat endeavored to persuade his subjects to take a firm stand against idolatrous practices. Many of the people in his realm \"offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.\" 1 Kings 22:43. The king did not at once destroy these shrines; but from the beginning he tried to safeguard Judah from the sins characterizing the northern kingdom under the rule of Ahab, of whom he was a contemporary for many years. Jehoshaphat himself was loyal to God. He \"sought not unto Baalim; but sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in His commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.\" Because of his integrity, the Lord was with him, and \"stablished the kingdom in his hand.\" 2 Chronicles 17:3-5.",
