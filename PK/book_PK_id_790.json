    "word": "In the crisis, Hezekiah proved to be a man of opportunity. No sooner had he ascended the throne than he began to plan and to execute. He first turned his attention to the restoration of the temple services, so long neglected; and in this work he earnestly solicited the co-operation of a band of priests and Levites who had remained true to their sacred calling. Confident of their loyal support, he spoke with them freely concerning his desire to institute immediate and far-reaching reforms. \"Our fathers have trespassed,\" he confessed, \"and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God, and have forsaken Him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord.\" \"Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel, that His fierce wrath may turn away from us.\" 2 Chronicles 29:6, 10.",
