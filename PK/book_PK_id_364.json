    "word": "From the depths of discouragement and despondency Job rose to the heights of implicit trust in the mercy and the saving power of God. Triumphantly he declared:           \"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him: . . . \n           He also shall be my salvation.\" \n          \"I know that my Redeemer liveth, \n           And that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: \n           And though after my skin worms destroy this body, \n           Yet in my flesh shall I see God: \n           Whom I shall see for myself, \n           And mine eyes shall behold, and not another.\" \n                                  Job 13:15, 16; 19:25-27.",
