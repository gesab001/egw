{"word": "In a written proclamation published \"throughout all his kingdom,\" Cyrus made known his desire to provide for the return of the Hebrews and for the rebuilding of their temple. \"The Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth,\" the king gratefully acknowledged in this public proclamation; \"and He hath charged me to build Him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all His people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, . . . and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, (He is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering.\" Ezra 1:1-4.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 558}
