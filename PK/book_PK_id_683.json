{"word": "\"Come, and let us return unto the Lord,\" the prophet entreated; \"for He hath torn, and He will heal us; He hath smitten, and He will bind us up. After two days will He revive us: in the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: His going forth is prepared as the morning; and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\" Hosea 6:1-3.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 283}
