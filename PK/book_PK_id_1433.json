{"word": "And yet this was the building concerning which the Lord had declared by the prophet Haggai: \"The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former.\" \"I will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Haggai 2:9, 7. For centuries learned men have endeavored to show wherein the promise of God, given to Haggai, has been fulfilled; yet in the advent of Jesus of Nazareth, the Desire of all nations, who by His personal presence hallowed the precincts of the temple, many have steadfastly refused to see any special significance. Pride and unbelief have blinded their minds to the true meaning of the prophet's words.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 597}
