{"word": "From the day of his call to the close of his ministry, Jeremiah stood before Judah as \"a tower and a fortress\" against which the wrath of man could not prevail. \"They shall fight against thee,\" the Lord had forewarned His servant, \"but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord. And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.\" Jeremiah 6:27; 15:20, 21.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 419}
