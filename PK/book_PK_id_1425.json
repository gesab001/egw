From the beginning, adversaries had \"weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,\" \"and made them to cease by force and power.\" Ezra 4:4, 23. But the Lord had interposed in behalf of the builders, and now He spoke through His prophet to Zerubbabel, saying, \"Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.\" Zechariah 4:7.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 594}
