    "word": "In rebuilding the house of the Lord, Zerubbabel had  labored in the face of manifold difficulties. From the beginning, adversaries had \"weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,\" \"and made them to cease by force and power.\" Ezra 4:4, 23. But the Lord had interposed in behalf of the builders, and now He spoke through His prophet to Zerubbabel, saying, \"Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.\" Zechariah 4:7.",
