{"word": "In vision the prophet beholds \"Joshua the high priest,\" \"clothed with filthy garments\" (Zechariah 3:1, 3), standing before the Angel of the Lord, entreating God's mercy in behalf of his afflicted people. As he pleads for the fulfillment of God's promises, Satan stands up boldly to resist him. He points to the transgressions of Israel as a reason why they should not be restored to the favor of God. He claims them as his prey, and demands that they be given into his hands.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 583}
