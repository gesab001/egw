{"word": "No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste, is recognized by God. He is the Maker of all mankind. \n                                                                           370\nAll men are of one family by creation, and all are one through redemption. Christ came to demolish every wall of partition, to throw open every compartment of the temple courts, that every soul may have free access to God. His love is so broad, so deep, so full, that it penetrates everywhere. It lifts out of Satan's influence those who have been deluded by his deceptions, and places them within reach of the throne of God, the throne encircled by the rainbow of promise. In Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 369}
