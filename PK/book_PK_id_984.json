{"word": "Naturally of a timid and shrinking disposition, Jeremiah longed for the peace and quiet of a life of retirement, where \n                                                                           420\nhe need not witness the continued impenitence of his beloved nation. His heart was wrung with anguish over the ruin wrought by sin. \"O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears,\" he mourned, \"that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! O that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them.\" Jeremiah 9:1, 2.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 419}
