{"word": "The inhabitants of Judah were all undeserving, yet God would not give them up. By them His name was to be exalted among the heathen. Many who were wholly unacquainted with His attributes were yet to behold the glory of the divine character. It was for the purpose of making plain His merciful designs that He kept sending His servants the prophets with the message, \"Turn ye again now everyone from his evil way.\" Jeremiah 25:5. \"For My name's sake,\" He declared through Isaiah, \"will I defer Mine anger, and for My praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.\" \"For Mine own sake, even for Mine own sake, will I do it: for how should My name be polluted? and I will not give My glory unto another.\" Isaiah 48:9, 11.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 319}
