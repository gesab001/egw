{"word": "The decree of Artaxerxes Longimanus for the restoring and building of Jerusalem, the third issued since the close of the seventy years' captivity, is remarkable for its expressions regarding the God of heaven, for its recognition of the attainments of Ezra, and for the liberality of the grants made to the remnant people of God.  Artaxerxes refers to Ezra as \"the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of His statutes to Israel;\" \"a scribe of the law of the God of heaven.\" The king united with his counselors in offering freely \"unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem;\" and in addition he made provision for meeting many heavy expenses by ordering that they be paid \"out of the king's treasure house.\" Verses 11, 12, 15, 20.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 610}
