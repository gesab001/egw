{"word": "In the intervals of His journeys to and fro, Jesus dwelt at Capernaum, which came to be known as \"His own city.\" Matthew 9:1. Situated on the highway from Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt and to the Mediterranean Sea, it was well adapted to be the center of the Saviour's work. People from many lands passed through the city or tarried for rest. There Jesus met with those of all nations and all ranks, and thus His lessons were carried to other countries and into many households. By this means interest was aroused in the prophecies pointing forward to the Messiah, attention was directed to the Saviour, and His mission was brought before the world.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 73}
