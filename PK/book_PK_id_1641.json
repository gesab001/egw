    "word": "In patriarchal times the sacrificial offerings connected with divine worship constituted a perpetual reminder of the coming of a Saviour, and thus it was with the entire ritual of the sanctuary services throughout Israel's history. In the ministration of the tabernacle, and of the temple that afterward took its place, the people were taught each day, by means of types and shadows, the great truths relative to the advent of Christ as Redeemer, Priest, and King; and once each year their minds were carried forward to the closing events of the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the final purification of the universe from sin and sinners. The sacrifices and offerings of the Mosaic ritual were ever pointing toward a better service, even a heavenly. The earthly sanctuary was \"a figure for the time then present,\" in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices; its two holy places were \"patterns of things in the heavens;\" for Christ, our great High Priest, is today \"a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.\" Hebrews 9:9, 23; 8:2.",
