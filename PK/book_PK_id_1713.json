{"word": "In Malachi's day the mocking inquiry of the impenitent, \"Where is the God of judgment?\" met with the solemn response: \"The Lord . . . shall suddenly come to His temple, even the Messenger of the covenant. . . . But who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.\" Malachi 2:17; 3:1-4.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 715}
