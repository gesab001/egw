{"word": "Have you, reader, chosen your own way? Have you wandered far from God? Have you sought to feast upon the fruits of transgression, only to find them turn to ashes upon your lips? And now, your life plans thwarted and your hopes dead, do you sit alone and desolate? That voice which has long been speaking to your heart, but to which you would not listen, comes to you distinct and clear, \"Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, \n                                                                           320\nit shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.\" Micah 2:10. Return to your Father's house. He invites you, saying, \"Return unto Me; for I have redeemed thee.\" \"Come unto Me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.\" Isaiah 44:22; 55:3.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 319}
