    "word": "As Satan accused Joshua and his people, so in all ages he accuses those who seek the mercy and favor of God. He is \"the accuser of our brethren, . . . which accused them before our God day and night.\" Revelation 12:10. Over every soul that is rescued from the power of evil, and whose name is registered in the Lamb's book of life, the controversy is repeated. Never is one received into the family of God without exciting the determined resistance of the enemy. But He who was the hope of Israel then, their defense, their justification and redemption, is the hope of the church today.",
