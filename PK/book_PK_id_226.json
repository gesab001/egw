{"word": "The penalty that overtook the unfaithful messenger was a still further evidence of the truth of the prophecy uttered over the altar. If, after disobeying the word of the Lord, the prophet had been permitted to go on in safety, the king would have used this fact in an attempt to vindicate his own disobedience. In the rent altar, in the palsied arm, and in the terrible fate of the one who dared disobey an express command of Jehovah, Jeroboam should have discerned the swift displeasure of an offended God, and these judgments should have warned him not to persist in wrongdoing. But, far from repenting, Jeroboam \"made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.\" Thus he not only sinned greatly himself, but \"made Israel to sin;\" and \"this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.\" Verses 33, 34; 14:16.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 107}
