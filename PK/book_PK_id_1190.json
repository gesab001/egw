    "word": "The power exercised by every ruler on the earth is Heaven-imparted; and upon his use of the power thus bestowed, his success depends. To each the word of the divine Watcher is, \"I girded thee, though thou hast not known Me.\" Isaiah 45:5. And to each the words spoken to Nebuchadnezzar of old are the lesson of life: \"Break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor: if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.\" Daniel 4:27.",
