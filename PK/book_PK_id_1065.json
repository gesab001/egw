The outlook for Judah was hopeless. \"Behold, I am against thee,\" the Lord Himself declared through Ezekiel. \"I the Lord have drawn forth My sword out of his sheath\" it shall not return any more. . . . Every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water.\" \"I will pour out Mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of My wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skillful to destroy.\" Ezekiel 21:3, 5-7, 31.",
