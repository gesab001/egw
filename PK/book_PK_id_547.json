{"word": "Of the hitherto polluted spring at Jericho, the Lord declared, \"I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.\" The polluted stream represents the soul that is separate from God. Sin not only shuts away from God, but destroys in the human soul both the desire and the capacity for knowing Him. Through sin, the whole human organism is deranged, the mind is perverted, the imagination corrupted; the faculties of the soul are degraded. There is an absence of pure religion, of heart holiness. The converting power of God has not wrought in transforming the character. The soul is weak, and for want of moral force to overcome, is polluted and debased.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 233}
