    "word": "In former years the king had not been indifferent to the prevailing idolatry. \"In the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,\" he had consecrated himself fully to the service of God. Four years later, at the age of twenty, he had made an earnest effort to remove temptation from his subjects by purging \"Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.\" \"They brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.\" 2 Chronicles 34:3-5.",
