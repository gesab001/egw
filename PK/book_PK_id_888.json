But the hearts of those to whom had been entrusted a knowledge of saving truth, were untouched by the needs of those around them.

The nations were overspread with a veil of ignorance; the love of God was little known; error and superstition flourished.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 371}
