{"word": "Amidst great discouragement, Nehemiah made God his trust, his sure defense. And He who was the support of His servant then has been the dependence of His people in every age. In every crisis His people may confidently declare, \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\" Romans 8:31. However craftily the plots of Satan and his agents may be laid, God can detect them, and bring to nought all their counsels. The response of faith today will be the response made by Nehemiah, \"Our God shall fight for us;\" for God is in the work, and no man can prevent its ultimate success.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 645}
