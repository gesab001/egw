{"word": "Jeremiah's message to priests and people aroused the antagonism of many. With boisterous denunciation they cried out, \"Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.\" Jeremiah 26:9.

Thus was the message of God despised, and His servant threatened with death.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 417}
