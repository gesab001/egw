{"word": "Jeremiah, in the presence of the priests and people, earnestly entreated them to submit to the king of Babylon for the time the Lord had specified. He cited the men of Judah to the prophecies of Hosea, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, and others whose messages of reproof and warning had been similar to his own.

In the past the judgments of God had been visited upon the impenitent in exact fulfillment of His purpose as revealed through His messengers.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 445}
