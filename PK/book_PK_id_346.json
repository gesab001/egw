{"word": "Chap. 12 - From Jezreel to Horeb\n\n     With the slaying of the prophets of Baal, the way was opened for carrying forward a mighty spiritual reformation among the ten tribes of the northern kingdom. Elijah had set before the people their apostasy; he had called upon them to humble their hearts and turn to the Lord. The judgments of Heaven had been executed; the people had confessed their sins, and had acknowledged the God of their fathers as the living God; and now the curse of Heaven was to be withdrawn, and the temporal blessings of life renewed. The land was to be refreshed with rain. \"Get thee up, eat and drink,\" Elijah said to Ahab; \"for there is a sound of abundance of rain.\" Then the prophet went to the top of the mount to pray.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 155}
