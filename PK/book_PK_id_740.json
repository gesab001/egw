    "word": "His burden of soul in behalf of erring Judah was not to be borne in vain. His mission was not to be wholly fruitless. Yet the evils that had been multiplying for many generations could not be removed in his day. Throughout his lifetime he must be a patient, courageous teacher--a prophet of hope as well as of doom. The divine purpose finally accomplished, the full fruitage of his efforts, and of the labors of all God's faithful messengers, would appear. A remnant should be saved. That this might be brought about, the messages of warning and entreaty were to be delivered to the rebellious nation, the Lord declared: \n\n\n          \"Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, \n           And the houses without man, \n           And the land be utterly desolate, \n           And the Lord have removed men far away, \n           And there be a great forsaking in the midst \n                of the land.\" \n                                Verses 11, 12.",
