Isaiah heard the Lord declaring to His chosen ones: \"I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. Put Me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.\" \"Thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.\" Verses 25, 26; 60:16.",
