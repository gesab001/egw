{"word": "Of those times of transition, when the pride of man shall be laid low, Jeremiah testifies: \"I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down.\" \"Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.\" Jeremiah 4:23-26; 30:7.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 727}
