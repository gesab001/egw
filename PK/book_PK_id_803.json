{"word": "The occasion was one of the greatest profit to the multitudes assembled. The desecrated streets of the city were cleared of the idolatrous shrines placed there during the reign of Ahaz. On the appointed day the Passover was observed, and the week was spent by the people in offering peace offerings and in learning what God would have them do. Daily the Levites \"taught the good knowledge of the Lord;\" and those who had prepared their hearts to seek God, found pardon. A great gladness took possession of the worshiping multitude; \"the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing with loud instruments;\" all were united in their desire to praise Him who had proved so gracious and merciful.
