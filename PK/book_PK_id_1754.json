    "word": "The prophet caught the sound of music there, and song, such music and song as, save in the visions of God, no mortal ear has heard or mind conceived. \"The ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\" \"Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.\" \"As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there.\" \"They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the Lord.\" Isaiah 35:10;  51:3; Psalm 87:7; Isaiah 24:14.",
