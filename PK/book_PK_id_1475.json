As a special precaution in safeguarding the treasure, Ezra \"separated twelve of the chief of the priests\"--men whose faithfulness and fidelity had been proved--\"and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered.\" These men were solemnly charged to act as vigilant stewards over the treasure entrusted to their care. \"Ye are holy unto the Lord,\" Ezra declared; \"the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the Lord God of your fathers. Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, \n                                                                           617\nand chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the Lord.\" Verses 24, 25, 28, 29.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 616}
