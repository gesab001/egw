    "word": "While Satan was striving to influence the highest powers in the kingdom of Medo-Persia to show disfavor to God's people, angels worked in behalf of the exiles. The controversy was one in which all heaven was interested. Through the prophet Daniel we are given a glimpse of this mighty struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil. For three weeks Gabriel wrestled with the powers of darkness, seeking to counteract the influences at work on the mind of Cyrus; and before the contest closed, Christ Himself came to Gabriel's aid. \"The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days,\" Gabriel declares; \"but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.\" Daniel 10:13. All that heaven could do in behalf of the people of God was done.
