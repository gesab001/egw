When those who are uniting with the world, yet claiming great purity, plead for union with those who have ever been the opposers of the cause of truth, we should fear and shun them as decidedly as did Nehemiah.

Whatever influence would tend to unsettle the faith of God's people in His guiding power, should be steadfastly withstood.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 660}
