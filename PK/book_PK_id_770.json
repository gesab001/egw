    "word": "This was indeed a time of great peril for the chosen nation. Only a few short years, and the ten tribes of the kingdom of Israel were to be scattered among the nations of heathendom. And in the kingdom of Judah also the outlook was dark. The forces for good were rapidly diminishing, the forces for evil multiplying. The prophet Micah, viewing the situation, was constrained to exclaim: \"The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men.\" \"The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge.\" Micah 7:2, 4. \"Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant,\" declared Isaiah, \"we should have been as Sodom, and . . . Gomorrah.\" Isaiah 1:9.",
