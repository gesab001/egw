    "word": "About a century had passed since, under the rulership of King David, Israel had joyfully united in chanting hymns of praise to the Most High, in recognition of their entire dependence on Him for daily mercies. Listen to their words of adoration as then they sang: \n\n\n     \"O God of our salvation, . . . \n       Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to \n         rejoice. \n     Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: \n      Thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full \n        of water: \n      Thou preparest them corn, when Thou hast so provided for it.      Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: Thou causest rain \n        to descend into the furrows thereof: \n      Thou makest it soft with showers: Thou blessest the springing \n        thereof. \n     Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness; \n      And Thy paths drop fatness. \n     They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: \n      And the little hills rejoice on every side. \n     The pastures are clothed with flocks; \n     The valleys also are covered over with corn; \n      They shout for joy, they also sing.\" \n                           Psalm 65:5, 8-13, margin.",
