From Philistia he received tribute money and presents; from Arabia, large flocks of sheep and goats. \"Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of stores. . . . Men of war, mighty men of valor, . . . waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.\" Verses 12-19. Blessed abundantly with \"riches and honor,\" he was enabled to wield a mighty influence for truth and righteousness. 2 Chronicles 18:1.",
