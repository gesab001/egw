{"word": "The result that would follow an entrance into covenant relation with surrounding nations was plainly foretold. \"The Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other,\" Moses had declared; \"and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone. And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: in the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.\" Deuteronomy 28:64-67. \"But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God,\" the promise had been, \"thou shalt find Him, if thou seek Him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.\" Deuteronomy 4:29.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 569}
