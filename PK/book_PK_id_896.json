{"word": "The prophet heard the voice of God calling His church to her appointed work, that the way might be prepared for the ushering in of His everlasting kingdom. The message was unmistakably plain: \n\n\n     \"Arise, shine; for thy light is come, \n      And the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. \n\n\n     \"For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, \n      And gross darkness the people: \n      But the Lord shall arise upon thee, \n      And His glory shall be seen upon thee. \n      And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, \n      And kings to the brightness of thy rising. \n\n\n     \"Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: \n      All they gather themselves together, they come to thee: \n      Thy sons shall come from far, \n      And thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.\" \n\n\n     \"And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, \n      And their kings shall minister unto thee: \n      For in My wrath I smote thee, \n      But in My favor have I had mercy on thee. \n      Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; \n      They shall not be shut day nor night; \n      That men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, \n      And that their kings may be brought.\" \n\n\n     \"Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: \n      For I am God, and there is none else.\" \n                       Isaiah 60:1-4, 10, 11; 45:22.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 375}
