{"word": "Chap. 38 - Light Through Darkness\n\n     The dark years of destruction and death marking the end of the kingdom of Judah would have brought despair to the stoutest heart had it not been for the encouragements in the prophetic utterances of God's messengers. Through Jeremiah in Jerusalem, through Daniel in the court of Babylon, through Ezekiel on the banks of the Chebar, the Lord in mercy made clear His eternal purpose and gave assurance of His willingness to fulfill to His chosen people the promises recorded in the writings of Moses. That which He had said He would do for those who should prove true to Him, He would surely bring to pass. \"The word of God . . . liveth and abideth forever.\" 1 Peter 1:23.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 464}
