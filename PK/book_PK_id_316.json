{"word": "God cannot use men who, in time of peril, when the strength, courage, and influence of all are needed, are afraid to take a firm stand for the right. He calls for men who will do faithful battle against wrong, warring against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. It is to such as these that He will speak the words: \"Well done, good and faithful servant; . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\" Matthew 25:23.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 142}
