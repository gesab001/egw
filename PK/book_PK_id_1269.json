    "word": "Thus \"the broad walls of Babylon\" became \"utterly broken, and her high gates . . . burned with fire.\" Thus did Jehovah of hosts \"cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,\" and lay low \"the haughtiness of the terrible.\" Thus did \"Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency,\" become as Sodom and Gomorrah--a place forever accursed. \"It shall never be inhabited,\" Inspiration has declared, \"neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces.\" \"I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Jeremiah 51:58; Isaiah 13:11, 19-22; 14:23.",
