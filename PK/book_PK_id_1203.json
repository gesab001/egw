{"word": "The king commanded that the men be brought before him. \"Is it true,\" he inquired, \"do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?\" He endeavored by threats to induce them to unite with the multitude. Pointing to the fiery furnace, he reminded them of the punishment awaiting them if they should persist in their refusal to obey his will. But firmly the Hebrews testified to their allegiance to the God of heaven, and their faith in His power to deliver. The act of bowing to the image was understood by all to be an act of worship. Such homage they could render to God alone.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 507}
