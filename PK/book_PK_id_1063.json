{"word": "\"Shall he prosper?\" the Lord inquired concerning the one who had thus basely betrayed every sacred trust; \"shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered? As I live, saith the Lord God, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war: . . . seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.\" Ezekiel 17:15-18.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 451}
