{"word": "The second temple was honored, not with the cloud of Jehovah's glory, but with the presence of the One in whom dwelt \"all the fullness of the Godhead bodily\"--God Himself \"manifest in the flesh.\" Colossians 2:9; 1 Timothy 3:16. In being honored with the personal presence of Christ during His earthly ministry, and in this alone, did the second temple exceed the first in glory. The \"Desire of all nations\" had indeed come to His temple, when the Man of Nazareth taught and healed in the sacred courts.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 597}
