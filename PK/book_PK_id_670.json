{"word": "\"Behold, the Lord cometh out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.\" Isaiah 26:21. The storm of God's wrath is gathering; and those only will stand who respond to the invitations of mercy, as did the inhabitants of Nineveh under the preaching of Jonah, and become sanctified through obedience to the laws of the divine Ruler. The righteous alone shall be hid with Christ in God till the desolation be overpast. Let the language of the soul be: \n\n\n          \"Other refuge have I none, \n            Hangs my helpless soul on Thee; \n           Leave, O, leave me not alone! \n            Still support and comfort me. \n\n\n          \"Hide me, O my Saviour, hide! \n            Till the storm of life is past; \n          Safe into the haven guide, \n           O receive my soul at last!\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 278}
