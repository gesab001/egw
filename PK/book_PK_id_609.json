{"word": "\"Fear not,\" was the answer of the prophet; \"for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.\" And then, that the servant might know this for himself, \"Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray Thee, open his eyes, that he may see.\" \"The Lord opened the eyes of the young \n                                                                           257\nman; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.\" Between the servant of God and the hosts of armed foemen was an encircling band of heavenly angels. They had come down in mighty power, not to destroy, not to exact homage, but to encamp round about and minister to the Lord's weak and helpless ones.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 256}
