    "word": "Alas, how had the glory of Israel departed! Never before had the chosen people of God fallen so low in apostasy. Of \"the prophets of Baal\" there were \"four hundred and fifty,\" besides four hundred \"prophets of the groves.\" 1 Kings 18:19. Nothing short of the miracle-working power of God could preserve the nation from utter destruction. Israel had voluntarily separated herself from Jehovah, yet the Lord in compassion still yearned after those who had been led into sin, and He was about to send to them one of the mightiest of His prophets, through whom many were to be led back to allegiance to the God of their fathers.",
