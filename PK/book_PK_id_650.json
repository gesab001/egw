    "word": "As king and nobles, with the common people, the high and the low, \"repented at the preaching of Jonas\" (Matthew 12:41) and united in crying to the God of heaven, His mercy was granted them. He \"saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that He had said that He would do unto them; and He did it not.\" Jonah 3:10. Their doom was averted, the God of Israel was exalted and honored throughout the heathen world, and His law was revered. Not until many years later was Nineveh to fall a prey to the surrounding nations through forgetfulness of God and through boastful pride. [For an account of the downfall of Assyria, see chapter 30.]",
