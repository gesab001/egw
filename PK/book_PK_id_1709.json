    "word": "That which God purposed to do for the world through Israel, the chosen nation, He will finally accomplish through His church on earth today. He has \"let out His vineyard unto other husbandmen,\" even to His covenant-keeping people, who faithfully \"render Him the fruits in their seasons.\" Never has the Lord been without true representatives on this earth who have made His interests their own. These witnesses for God are numbered among the spiritual Israel, and to them will be fulfilled all the covenant promises made by Jehovah to His ancient people.",
