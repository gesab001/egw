{"word": "No longer have the hosts of evil power to keep the church captive; for \"Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city,\" which hath \"made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication;\" and to spiritual Israel is given the message, \"Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\" Verse 8; 18:4. As the captive exiles heeded the message, \"Flee out of the midst of Babylon\" (Jeremiah 51:6), and were restored to the Land of Promise, so those who fear God today are heeding the message to withdraw from spiritual Babylon, and soon they are to stand as trophies of divine grace in the earth made new, the heavenly Canaan.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 715}
