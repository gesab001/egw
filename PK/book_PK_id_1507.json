    "word": "Overwhelmed with sorrow, Nehemiah could neither eat nor drink; he \"wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted.\" In his grief he turned to the divine Helper. \"I . . . prayed,\" he said, \"before the God of heaven.\" Faithfully he made confession of his sins and the sins of his people. He pleaded that God would maintain the cause of Israel, restore their courage and strength, and help them to build up the waste places of Judah.",
