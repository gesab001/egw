    "word": "Oh, what an opportunity was Solomon's! Should he follow the divinely inspired instruction of his father, his reign would be a reign of righteousness, like that described in the seventy-second psalm: \n\n\n     \"Give the king Thy judgments, O God, \n      And Thy righteousness unto the king's son. \n      He shall judge Thy people with righteousness, \n      And Thy poor with judgment. . . . \n      He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: \n      As showers that water the earth.       In his days shall the righteous flourish; \n      And abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. \n      He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, \n      And from the river unto the ends of the earth. . . . \n      The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: \n      The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. \n      Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: \n      All nations shall serve him. \n      For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; \n      The poor also, and him that hath no helper. . . . \n      Prayer also shall be made for him continually; \n      And daily shall he be praised. . . . \n      His name shall endure forever: \n      His name shall be continued as long as the sun: \n      And men shall be blessed in him: \n      All nations shall call him blessed. \n\n\n     \"Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, \n      Who only doeth wondrous things. \n      And blessed be His glorious name forever: \n      And let the whole earth be filled with His glory; \n         Amen, and Amen.\"",
