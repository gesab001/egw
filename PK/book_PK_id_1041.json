Especially were they to turn from the teaching of false prophets who might counsel otherwise. \"Hearken not ye to your prophets,\" the Lord declared, \"nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should \n                                                                           444\ndrive you out, and ye should perish. But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the Lord; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.\" Verses 8-11.
