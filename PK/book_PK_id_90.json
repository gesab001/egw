{"word": "Hundreds of years before Solomon came to the throne, the Lord, foreseeing the perils that would beset those who might be chosen as rulers of Israel, gave Moses instruction for their guidance. Directions were given that he who should sit on the throne of Israel should \"write him a copy\" of the statutes of Jehovah \"in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites.\" \"It shall be with him,\" the Lord said, \"and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them: that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.\" Deuteronomy 17:18-20.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 52}
