    "word": "The advancing hosts of Israel found that knowledge of the mighty workings of the God of the Hebrews had gone before them, and that some among the heathen were learning that He alone was the true God. In wicked Jericho the testimony of a heathen woman was, \"The Lord your God, He is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.\" Joshua 2:11. The knowledge of Jehovah that had thus come to her, proved her salvation. By faith \"Rahab perished not with them that believed not.\" Hebrews 11:31. And her conversion was not an isolated case of God's mercy toward idolaters who acknowledged His divine authority. In the midst of the land a numerous people--the Gibeonites--renounced their heathenism and united with Israel, sharing in the blessings of the covenant.",
