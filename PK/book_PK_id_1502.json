Thus the Lord designs that the light shall shine forth through His followers today. If the saints of the Old Testament bore so bright a testimony of loyalty, should not those upon whom is shining the accumulated light of centuries, bear a still more signal witness to the power of truth? The glory of the prophecies sheds their light upon our pathway. \n                                                                           627\nType has met antitype in the death of God's Son. Christ has risen from the dead, proclaiming over the rent sepulcher, \"I am the resurrection, and the life.\" John 11:25. He has sent His Spirit into the world to bring all things to our remembrance. By a miracle of power He has preserved His written word through the ages.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 626}
