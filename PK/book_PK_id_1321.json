{"word": "Shortly before the fall of Babylon, when Daniel was meditating on these prophecies and seeking God for an understanding of the times, a series of visions was given him concerning the rise and fall of kingdoms. With the first vision, as recorded in the seventh chapter of the book of Daniel, an interpretation was given; yet not all was made clear to the prophet. \"My cogitations much troubled me,\" he wrote of his experience at the time, \"and my countenance \n                                                                           554\nchanged in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.\" Daniel 7:28.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 553}
