    "word": "\"All Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honor in abundance. And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.\" As time passed and reformations were wrought, the king \"took away the high places and groves out of Judah.\" Verses 5, 6. \"And the remnant of the Sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.\" 1 Kings 22:46. Thus gradually the inhabitants of Judah were freed from many of the perils that had been threatening to retard seriously their spiritual development.",
