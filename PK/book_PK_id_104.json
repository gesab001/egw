    "word": "On the southern eminence of the Mount of Olives, opposite Mount Moriah, where stood the beautiful temple of Jehovah, Solomon erected an imposing pile of buildings to be used as idolatrous shrines. To please his wives, he placed huge idols, unshapely images of wood and stone, amidst the groves of myrtle and olive. There, before the altars of heathen deities, \"Chemosh, the abomination of Moab,\" and \"Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon,\" were practiced the most degrading rites of heathenism. Verse 7.",
