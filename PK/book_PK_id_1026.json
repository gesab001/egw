{"word": "The burning of the roll was not the end of the matter. The written words were more easily disposed of than the reproof and warning they contained and the swift-coming punishment God had pronounced against rebellious Israel. But even the written roll was reproduced. \"Take thee again another roll,\" the Lord commanded His servant, \"and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.\" The record of the prophecies concerning Judah and Jerusalem had been \n                                                                           437\nreduced to ashes; but the words were still living in the heart of Jeremiah, \"as a burning fire,\" and the prophet was permitted to reproduce that which the wrath of man would fain have destroyed.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 436}
