    "word": "The prophet exalted God as Creator of all. His message to the cities of Judah was, \"Behold your God!\" Isaiah 40:9. \"Thus saith God the Lord, He that created the heavens, and stretched them out; He that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it;\" \"I am the Lord that maketh all things;\" \"I form the light, and create darkness;\" \"I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even My hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.\" Isaiah 42:5; 44:24; Isaiah 45:7, 12. \"To whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth.\" Isaiah 40:25, 26.",
