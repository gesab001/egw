    "word": "The day of wrath to the enemies of God is the day of final deliverance to His church. The prophet declares: \n\n\n          \"Strengthen ye the weak hands, \n           And confirm the feeble knees.            Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be \n                  strong, fear not: \n           Behold, your God will come with vengeance, \n           Even God with a recompense; \n           He will come and save you.\" \n\n\"He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of His people shall He take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.\" Isaiah 35:3, 4; 25:8. And as the prophet beholds the Lord of glory descending from heaven with all the holy angels, to gather the remnant church from among the nations of earth, he hears the waiting ones unite in the exultant cry: \n\n\n          \"Lo, this is our God; \n            We have waited for Him, \n            And He will save us: \n           This is the Lord; \n            We have waited for Him, \n            We will be glad and rejoice \n               in His salvation.\" \n                             Isaiah 25:9.",
