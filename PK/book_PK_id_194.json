    "word": "For three years Rehoboam tried to profit by his sad experience at the beginning of his reign; and in this effort he was prospered. He \"built cities for defense in Judah,\" and \"fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.\" He was careful to make these fortified cities \"exceeding strong.\" 2 Chronicles 11:5, 11, 12. But the secret of Judah's prosperity during the first years of Rehoboam's reign lay not in these measures. It was their recognition of God as the Supreme Ruler that placed the tribes of Judah and Benjamin on vantage ground. To their number were added many God-fearing men from the northern tribes. \"Out of all the tribes of Israel,\" the record reads, \"such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers. So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.\" Verses 16, 17.",
