{"word": "Through the setting up of a false sabbath, the enemy thought to change times and laws. But has he really succeeded in changing God's law? The words of the thirty-first chapter of Exodus are the answer. He who is the same yesterday, today, and forever, has declared of the seventh-day Sabbath: \"It is a sign between Me and you throughout your \n                                                                           185\ngenerations.\" \"It is a sign . . . forever.\" Exodus 31:13, 17. The changed signpost is pointing the wrong way, but God has not changed. He is still the mighty God of Israel. \"Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, He taketh up the isles as a very little thing. And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. All nations before Him are as nothing; and they are counted to Him less than nothing, and vanity.\" Isaiah 40:15-17. And He is just as jealous for His law now as He was in the days of Ahab and Elijah.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 184}
