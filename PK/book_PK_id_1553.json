{"word": "The Lord had commanded Israel, through Moses, that every third year a tithe be raised for the benefit of the poor; \n                                                                           647\nand a further provision had been made in the suspension of agricultural labor every seventh year, the land lying fallow, its spontaneous products being left to those in need. Faithfulness in devoting these offerings to the relief of the poor and to other benevolent uses would have tended to keep fresh before the people the truth of God's ownership of all, and their opportunity to be channels of blessing. It was Jehovah's purpose that the Israelites should have a training that would eradicate selfishness, and develop breadth and nobility of character.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 646}
