{"word": "\"So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah,\" with the pressing invitation, \"Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. . . . Be ye not stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into His sanctuary, which He hath sanctified forever: and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you. For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away His face from you; if ye return unto Him.\" 2 Chronicles 30:5-9. \n                                                                           291", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 288}
