{"word": "These were among the wise counsels of Jehovah to ancient Israel. \"Lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul,\" He had commanded His chosen people, \"and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, \n                                                                           137\nand when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\" Deuteronomy 11:18, 19. Plain were these commands, yet as the centuries passed, and generation after generation lost sight of the provision made for their spiritual welfare, the ruinous influences of apostasy threatened to sweep aside every barrier of divine grace.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 136}
