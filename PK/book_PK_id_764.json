{"word": "The messages borne by Isaiah to those who chose to turn from their evil ways were full of comfort and encouragement. Hear the word of the Lord through His prophet: \n\n\n     \"Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; \n      For thou art My servant: \n      I have formed thee; thou art My servant: \n      O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of Me. \n      I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, \n      And, as a cloud, thy sins: \n      Return unto Me; for I have redeemed thee.\" \n                               Isaiah 44:21, 22. \n\n\n     \"In that day thou shalt say, \n      O Lord, I will praise Thee: \n      Though Thou wast angry with me, \n      Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortedst me. \n\n\n     \"Behold, God is my salvation; \n      I will trust, and not be afraid: \n      For the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; \n      He also is become my salvation. . . . \n\n\n     \"Sing unto the Lord; for He hath done excellent things: \n      This is known in all the earth. \n      Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: \n      For great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.\" \n                                                 Isaiah 12.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 321}
