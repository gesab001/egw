{"word": "At Gilgal, also, while the dearth was still in the land, Elisha fed one hundred men with the present brought to him by \"a man from Baalshalisha,\" \"bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof.\" There were those with him who were sorely in need of food. When the offering came, he said to his servant, \"Give unto the people, that they may eat. And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 241}
