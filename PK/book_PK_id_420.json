    "word": "Today, as in the days of Elijah, the line of demarcation between God's commandment-keeping people and the worshipers of false gods is clearly drawn. \"How long halt ye between two opinions?\" Elijah cried; \"if the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then follow him.\" 1 Kings 18:21. And the message for today is: \"Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen. . . . Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.\" Revelation 18:2, 4, 5.",
