How sharp the contrast between the matchless perfection of his Creator, and the sinful course of those who, with himself, had long been numbered among the chosen people of Israel and Judah! \"Woe is me!\" he cried; \"for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: \n                                                                           308\nfor mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.\" Verse 5. Standing, as it were, in the full light of the divine presence within the inner sanctuary, he realized that if left to his own imperfection and inefficiency, he would be utterly unable to accomplish the mission to which he had been called.

A living coal from the altar was laid upon his lips, with the words, \"Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.\" Then the voice of God was heard saying, \"Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?\" and Isaiah responded, \"Here am I; send me.\" Verses 7, 8.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 307}
