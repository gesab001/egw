{"word": "Among earth's inhabitants, scattered in every land, there are those who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Like the stars of heaven, which appear only at night, these faithful ones will shine forth when darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people. In heathen Africa, in the Catholic lands of Europe and of South America, in China, in India, \n                                                                           189\nin the islands of the sea, and in all the dark corners of the earth, God has in reserve a firmament of chosen ones that will yet shine forth amidst the darkness, revealing clearly to an apostate world the transforming power of obedience to His law. Even now they are appearing in every nation, among every tongue and people; and in the hour of deepest apostasy, when Satan's supreme effort is made to cause \"all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\" to receive, under penalty of death, the sign of allegiance to a false rest day, these faithful ones, \"blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke,\" will \"shine as lights in the world.\" Revelation 13:16; Philippians 2:15. The darker the night, the more brilliantly will they shine.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 188}
