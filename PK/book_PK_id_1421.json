{"word": "Chap. 48 - \"Not by Might, nor by Power\"\n\n     Immediately after Zechariah's vision of Joshua and the Angel, the prophet received a message regarding the work of Zerubbabel. \"The Angel that talked with me,\" Zechariah declares, \"came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, and said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof: and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon  the left side thereof.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 593}
