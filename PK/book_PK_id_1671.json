{"word": "Then, said the angel, \"He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week [seven years].\" For seven years after the Saviour entered on His ministry, the gospel was to be preached especially to the Jews; for three and a half years by Christ Himself, and afterward by the apostles. \"In the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.\" Daniel 9:27. In the spring of A.D. 31, Christ, the true Sacrifice, was offered on Calvary. Then the veil of the temple was rent in twain, showing that the sacredness and significance of the sacrificial service had departed. The time had come for the earthly sacrifice and oblation to cease.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 699}
