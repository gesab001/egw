{"word": "\"Now therefore hearken,\" Moses had instructed Israel, \"unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you. Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you. . . . Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.\" Deuteronomy 4:1-6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 294}
