{"word": "Chap. 25 - The Call of Isaiah\n\n     The long reign of Uzziah [also known as Azariah] in the land of Judah and Benjamin was characterized by a prosperity greater than that of any other ruler since the death of Solomon, nearly two centuries before. For many years the king ruled with discretion. Under the blessing of Heaven his armies regained some of the territory that had been lost in former years. Cities were rebuilt and fortified, and the position of the nation among the surrounding peoples was greatly strengthened. Commerce revived, and the riches of the nations flowed into Jerusalem. Uzziah's name \"spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.\" 2 Chronicles 26:15.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 303}
