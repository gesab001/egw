    "word": "The widow of Zarephath shared her morsel with Elijah, and in return her life and that of her son were preserved. And to all who, in time of trial and want, give sympathy and assistance to others more needy, God has promised great blessing. He has not changed. His power is no less now than in the days of Elijah. No less sure now than when spoken by our Saviour is the promise, \"He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward.\" Matthew 10:41.",
