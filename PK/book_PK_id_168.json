    "word": "It is as true now as when the words were spoken to Israel of obedience to His commandments: \"This is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations.\" Deuteronomy 4:6. Here is the only safeguard for individual integrity, for the purity of the home, the well-being of society, or the stability of the nation. Amidst all life's perplexities and dangers and conflicting claims, the one safe and sure rule is to do what God says. \"The statutes of the Lord are right,\" and \"he that doeth these things shall never be moved.\" Psalm 19:8; 15:5.",
