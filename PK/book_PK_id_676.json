{"word": "There were times when the judgments of Heaven fell very heavily on the rebellious people. \"I hewed them by the prophets,\" God declared; \"I have slain them by the words of My mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against Me.\" Hosea 6:5-7.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 281}
