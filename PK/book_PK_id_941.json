So long had the inhabitants of the land followed the customs of the surrounding nations in bowing down to images of wood and stone, that it seemed almost beyond the power of man to remove every trace of these evils.

Sternly he met idolatry by slaying \"all the priests of the high places;\" \"moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord.\" Verses 20, 24.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 401}
