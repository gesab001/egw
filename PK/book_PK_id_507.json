{"word": "By faithfulness in little things, Elisha was preparing for weightier trusts. Day by day, through practical experience, he gained a fitness for a broader, higher work. He learned to serve; and in learning this, he learned also how to instruct and lead. The lesson is for all. None can know what may be God's purpose in His discipline; but all may be certain that faithfulness in little things is the evidence of fitness for greater responsibilities. Every act of life is a revelation of character, and he only who in small duties proves himself \"a workman that needeth not to be ashamed\" can be honored by God with higher service. 2 Timothy 2:15.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 218}
