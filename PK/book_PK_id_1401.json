{"word": "As the intercession of Joshua is accepted, the command is given, \"Take away the filthy garments from him;\" and to Joshua the Angel says, \"Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.\" \"So they set a fair miter upon his head, and clothed him with garments.\" Verses 4, 5. His own sins and those of his people were pardoned. Israel was clothed with \"change of raiment\"--the righteousness of Christ imputed to them. The miter placed upon Joshua's head was such as was worn by the priests, and bore the inscription, \"Holiness to the Lord\" (Exodus 28:36), signifying that notwithstanding his former transgressions, he was now qualified to minister before God in His sanctuary.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 584}
