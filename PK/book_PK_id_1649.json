    "word": "In the later centuries of Israel's history prior to the first advent it was generally understood that the coming of the Messiah was referred to in the prophecy, \"It is a light thing that Thou shouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth.\" \"The glory of the Lord shall be revealed,\" the prophet had foretold, \"and all flesh shall see it together.\" Isaiah 49:6; 40:5. It was of this light of men that John the Baptist afterward testified so boldly, when he proclaimed, \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.\" John 1:23.",
