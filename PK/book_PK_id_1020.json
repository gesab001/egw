{"word": "When King Jehoiakim was told by the princes what Baruch had read, he immediately ordered the roll brought before him and read in his hearing. One of the royal attendants, Jehudi by name, fetched the roll and began reading the words of reproof and warning. It was the time of winter, and the king and his companions of state, the princes of Judah, were gathered about an open fire. Only a small portion had been read, when the king, far from trembling \n                                                                           434\nat the danger hanging over himself and his people, seized the roll and in a frenzy of rage \"cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed.\" Verse 23.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 433}
