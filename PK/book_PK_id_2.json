{"word": "Men had well-nigh lost the knowledge of the true God. Their minds were darkened by idolatry. For the divine statutes, which are \"holy, and just, and good\" (Romans 7:12), men were endeavoring to substitute laws in harmony with the purposes of their own cruel, selfish hearts. Yet God in His mercy did not blot them out of existence. He purposed to give them opportunity for becoming acquainted with Him \n                                                                           16\nthrough His church. He designed that the principles revealed through His people should be the means of restoring the moral image of God in man.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 15}
