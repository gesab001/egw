{"word": "Chap. 41 - The Fiery Furnace\n\n     The dream of the great image, opening before Nebuchadnezzar events reaching to the close of time, had been given that he might understand the part he was to act in the world's history, and the relation that his kingdom should sustain to the kingdom of heaven. In the interpretation of the dream, he had been plainly instructed regarding the establishment of God's everlasting kingdom. \"In the days of these kings,\" Daniel had declared, \"shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. . . . The dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.\" Daniel 2:44, 45.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 503}
