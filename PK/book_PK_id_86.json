{"word": "Although God dwells not in temples made with hands, yet He honors with His presence the assemblies of His people. He has promised that when they come together to seek Him, to acknowledge their sins, and to pray for one another, He will meet with them by His Spirit. But those who assemble to worship Him should put away every evil thing. Unless they worship Him in spirit and truth and in the beauty of holiness, their coming together will be of no avail. Of such the Lord declares, \"This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth, and honoreth Me with their lips; but their heart is far from Me.\" Matthew 15:8, 9. Those who worship God must worship Him \"in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him.\" John 4:23.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 50}
