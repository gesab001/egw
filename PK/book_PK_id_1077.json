{"word": "The cowardly king knew that the charges were false; but in order to propitiate those who occupied high and influential positions in the nation, he feigned to believe their falsehoods and gave Jeremiah into their hands to do with him as they pleased. The prophet was cast \"into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.\" Verse 6. But God raised up friends for him, who besought the king in his behalf, and had him again removed to the court of the prison.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 456}
