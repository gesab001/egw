They are new every morning: great is Thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in Him. The Lord is good unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeketh Him. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.\" Lamentations 3:18, 22-26.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 421}
