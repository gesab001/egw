    "word": "When called to drink of the cup of tribulation and sorrow, and when tempted in his misery to say, \"My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord,\" he recalled the providences of God in his behalf and triumphantly exclaimed, \"It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is Thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in Him. The Lord is good unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeketh Him. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.\" Lamentations 3:18, 22-26.",
