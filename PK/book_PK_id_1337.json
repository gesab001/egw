Many, like Daniel, had been studying the prophecies, and had been seeking God for His promised intervention in behalf of Zion. And now their prayers were being answered; and with heartfelt joy they could unite in singing: \n\n\n          \"When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, \n           We were like them that dream. \n            Then was our mouth filled with laughter, \n            And our tongue with singing: \n           Then said they among the heathen, \n           The Lord hath done great things for them. \n            The Lord hath done great things for us; \n            Whereof we are glad.\" \n                           Psalm 126:1-3.",
