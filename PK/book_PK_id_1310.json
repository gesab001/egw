    "word": "Honored by men with the responsibilities of state and with the secrets of kingdoms bearing universal sway, Daniel was honored by God as His ambassador, and was given many revelations of the mysteries of ages to come. His wonderful prophecies, as recorded by him in chapters 7 to 12 of the book bearing his name, were not fully understood even by the prophet himself; but before his life labors closed, he was given the blessed assurance that \"at the end of the days\"--in the closing period of this world's history--he would again be permitted to stand in his lot and place. It was not given him to understand all that God had revealed of the divine purpose. \"Shut up the words, and seal the book,\" he was directed concerning his prophetic writings; these were to be sealed \"even to the time of the end.\" \"Go thy way, Daniel,\" the angel once more directed the faithful messenger of Jehovah; \"for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. . . . Go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.\" Daniel 12:4, 9, 13.",
