{"word": "God had commanded that Jerusalem be rebuilt; the vision of the measuring of the city was an assurance that He would give comfort and strength to His afflicted ones, and fulfill to them the promises of His everlasting covenant. His protecting care, He declared, would be like \"a wall of fire round about;\" and through them His glory would be revealed to all the sons of men. That which He was accomplishing for His people was to be known in all the earth. \"Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.\" Isaiah 12:6.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 581}
