    "word": "\"The chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised\"--these were the goodly remnant, about fifty thousand strong, from among the Jews in the lands of exile, who determined to take advantage of the wonderful opportunity offered them \"to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.\" Their friends did not permit them to go empty-handed. \"All they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things.\" And to these and many other voluntary offerings were added \"the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem; . . . even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, . . . five thousand and four hundred\" in number, for use in the temple that was to be rebuilt. Ezra 1:5-11.",
