    "word": "In word and in deed the Messiah, during His earthly ministry, was to reveal to mankind the glory of God the Father. Every act of His life, every word spoken, every miracle wrought, was to make known to fallen humanity the infinite love of God. \n\n\n      \"O Zion, that bringest good tidings, \n         Get thee up into the high mountain; \n       O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, \n         Lift up thy voice with strength; \n       Lift it up, be not afraid; \n        Say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!       \"Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, \n        And His arm shall rule for Him: \n       Behold, His reward is with Him, \n      And His work before Him. \n        He shall feed His flock like a shepherd: \n        He shall gather the lambs with His arm, \n        And carry them in His bosom, \n        And shall gently lead those that are with young.\" \n                                       Isaiah 40:9-11. \n\n\n       \"And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the Book, \n        And the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out \n             of darkness. \n        The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, \n        And the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One \n             of Israel.\" \n\n\n      \"They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, \n       And they that murmured shall learn doctrine.\" \n                                        Isaiah 29:18, 19, 24.",
