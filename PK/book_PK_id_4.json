They showed His signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.\" \"He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: so He led them through the depths.\" Psalm 105:26, 27; 106:9. He rescued them from their servile state, that He might bring them to a good land, a land which in His providence He had prepared for them as a refuge from their enemies. He would bring them to Himself and encircle them in His everlasting arms; and in return for His goodness and mercy they were to exalt His name and make it glorious in the earth. \n                                                                           17", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 16}
