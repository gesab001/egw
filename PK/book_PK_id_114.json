    "word": "When, at the foot of Sinai, Moses told the people of the divine command, \"Let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them,\" the response of the Israelites was accompanied by the appropriate gifts. \"They came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing,\" and brought offerings. Exodus 25:8; 35:21. For the building of the sanctuary, great and extensive preparations were necessary; a large amount of the most precious and costly material was required, but the Lord accepted only freewill offerings. \"Of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take My offering,\" was the command repeated by Moses to the congregation. Exodus 25:2. Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice were the first requisites in preparing a dwelling place for the Most High.",
