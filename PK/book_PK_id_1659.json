{"word": "It was further prophesied of the Messiah: \"He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till He have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for His law.\" The Son of God was to \"magnify the law, and make it honorable.\" Verses 4, 21.

At the same time He was to free the divine precepts from those burdensome exactions placed upon them by man, whereby many were brought to discouragement in their efforts to serve God acceptably.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 693}
