{"word": "Again and again had Satan been defeated; and now, with deeper malice and cunning, he laid a still more subtle and dangerous snare for the servant of God. Sanballat and his companions hired men who professed to be the friends of Nehemiah, to give him evil counsel as the word of the Lord. The chief one engaged in this iniquitous work was Shemaiah, a man previously held in good repute by Nehemiah. This man shut himself up in a chamber near the sanctuary as if fearing that his life was in danger. The temple was at this time protected by walls and gates, but the gates of the city were not yet set up. Professing great concern for Nehemiah's safety, Shemaiah advised him to seek shelter in the temple. \"Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple,\" he proposed, \"and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 655}
