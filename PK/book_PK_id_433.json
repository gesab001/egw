{"word": "Although Jehoshaphat in a moment of weakness had rashly promised to join the king of Israel in his war against the Syrians, yet his better judgment led him to seek to learn the will of God concerning the undertaking. \"Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the Lord today,\" he suggested to Ahab. In response, Ahab called together four hundred of the false prophets of Samaria, and asked of them, \"Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?\" And they answered, \"Go up; for God will deliver it into the kings's hand.\" Verses 4, 5.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 195}
