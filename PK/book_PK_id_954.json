    "word": "Yet amid the general ruin into which the nation was rapidly passing, Jeremiah was often permitted to look beyond the distressing scenes of the present to the glorious prospects of the future, when God's people should be ransomed from the land of the enemy and planted again in Zion. He foresaw the time when the Lord would renew His covenant relationship with them. \"Their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.\" Jeremiah 31:12.",
