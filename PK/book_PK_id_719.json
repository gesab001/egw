{"word": "In symbolic language Hosea set before the ten tribes God's plan of restoring to every penitent soul who would unite with His church on earth, the blessings granted Israel in the days of their loyalty to Him in the Promised Land. Referring to Israel as one to whom He longed to show mercy, the Lord declared, \"I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. And it shall be at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call Me Ishi [\"My \n                                                                           299\nhusband,\" margin]; and shalt call Me no more Baali [\"My lord,\" margin]. For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.\" Hosea 2:14-17.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 298}
