    "word": "And in addition to these wonderful pleadings, the Lord gave His erring people the very words with which they might turn to Him. They were to say: \"Behold, we come unto Thee; for Thou art the Lord our God. Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel. . . . We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.\" Verses 22-25.",
