The Lord designed that by a faithful observance of the Sabbath command, Israel should continually be reminded of their accountability to Him as their Creator and their Redeemer. While they should keep the Sabbath in the proper spirit, idolatry could not exist; but should the claims of this precept of the Decalogue be set aside as no longer binding, the Creator would be forgotten and men would worship other gods. \"I gave them My Sabbaths,\" God declared, \"to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.\" Yet \"they despised My judgments, and walked not in My statutes, but polluted My Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.\" And in His appeal to them to return to Him, He called their attention anew to the importance of keeping the Sabbath holy. \"I am the Lord your God,\" He said; \"walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments, and do them; and hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.\" Ezekiel 20:12, 16, 19, 20.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PK", "page": 181}
