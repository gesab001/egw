{"word": "By sin we have been severed from the life of God. Our souls are palsied. Of ourselves we are no more capable of living a holy life than was the impotent man capable of walking. Many realize their helplessness; they are longing for that spiritual life which will bring them into harmony with God, and are striving to obtain it. But in vain. In despair they cry, \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?\" Romans 7:24, margin. Let these desponding, struggling ones look up. The Saviour is bending over the purchase of His blood, saying with inexpressible tenderness \n                                                                           85\nand pity, \"Wilt thou be made whole?\" He bids you arise in health and peace. Do not wait to feel that you are made whole. Believe the Saviour's word. Put your will on the side of Christ. Will to serve Him, and in acting upon His word you will receive strength. Whatever may be the evil practice, the master passion which through long indulgence binds both soul and body, Christ is able and longs to deliver. He will impart life to the soul that is \"dead in trespasses.\" Ephesians 2:1. He will set free the captive that is held by weakness and misfortune and the chains of sin.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 84}
