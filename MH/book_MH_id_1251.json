{"word": "Historical and Theological Lore \n\n     As a preparation for Christian work, many think it essential to acquire an extensive knowledge of historical and theological writings. They suppose that this knowledge will be an aid to them in teaching the gospel. But their laborious study of the opinions of men tends to the enfeebling of their ministry, rather than to its strengthening. As I see libraries filled with ponderous volumes of historical and theological lore, I think, Why spend money for that which is not bread? The sixth chapter of John tells us more than can be found in such works. Christ says: \"I am the Bread of Life: he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst.\" \"I am the living Bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this Bread, he shall live forever.\" \"He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life.\" \"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" John 6:35, 51, 47, 63.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 441}
