{"word": "Chap. 22 - Dress\n\n     The Bible teaches modesty in dress. \"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel.\" 1 Timothy 2:9. This forbids display in dress, gaudy colors, profuse ornamentation. Any device designed to attract attention to the wearer or to excite admiration, is excluded from the modest apparel which God's word enjoins.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 287}
