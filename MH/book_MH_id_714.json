{"word": "The fifty-eight chapter of Isaiah is a prescription for maladies of the body and of the soul. If we desire health and the true joy of life we must put into practice the rules given in this scripture. Of the service acceptable to Him, and its blessings, the Lord says: \n\n\n     \"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, \n      And that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? \n      When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; \n      And that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? \n                                                                           257\n\n     Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, \n     And thine health shall spring forth speedily: \n     And thy righteousness shall go before thee; \n     The glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward. \n     Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; \n     Thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am. \n     If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, \n     The putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; \n     And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, \n     And satisfy the afflicted soul; \n     Then shall thy light rise in obscurity, \n     And thy darkness be as the noonday: \n     And the Lord shall guide thee continually, \n     And satisfy thy soul in drought, \n     And make fat thy bones: \n     And thou shalt be like a watered garden, \n     And like a spring of water, \n     Whose waters fail not.\" \n                            Isaiah 58:7-11.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 256}
