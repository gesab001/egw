{"word": "There are multitudes struggling with poverty, compelled to labor hard for small wages, and able to secure but the barest necessities of life.

Careworn and oppressed, they know not where to turn for relief. Sympathize with them in their trials, their heartaches, and disappointments. This will open the way for you to help them. Speak to them of God's promises, pray with and for them, inspire them with hope. \n                                                                           159", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 158}
