{"word": "Think you not that Christ values those who live wholly for Him? Think you not that He visits those who, like the beloved John in exile, are for His sake in hard and trying places? God will not suffer one of His truehearted workers to be left alone, to struggle against great odds and be overcome. He preserves as a precious jewel everyone whose life is hid with Christ in Him. Of every such one He says: \"I . . . will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee.\" Haggai 2:23.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 488}
