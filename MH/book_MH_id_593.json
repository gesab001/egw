{"word": "Much is said concerning our duty to the neglected poor; should not some attention be given to the neglected rich? Many look upon this class as hopeless, and they do little to open the eyes of those, who, blinded and dazed by the glitter of earthly glory, have lost eternity out of their reckoning. Thousands of wealthy men have gone to their graves unwarned. But indifferent as they may appear, many among the rich are soul-burdened. \"He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase.\" He that says to fine gold, \"Thou art my confidence,\" has \"denied the God that is above.\" \"None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth forever).\" Ecclesiastes 5:10; Job 31:24, 28; Psalm 49:7, 8.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 210}
