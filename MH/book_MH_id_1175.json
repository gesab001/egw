{"word": "God is constantly employed in upholding and using as His servants the things that He has made. He works through the laws of nature, using them as His instruments. They are not self-acting. Nature in her work testifies of the intelligent presence and active agency of a Being who moves in all things according to His will. \n\n\n     \"Forever, O Lord, \n            Thy word is settled in heaven. \n      Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: \n            Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. \n      They continue this day according to Thine ordinances: \n            For all are Thy servants.\" \n     \"Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did He \n      In heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.\" \n     \"He commanded, and they were created. \n      He hath also established them for ever and ever: \n      He hath made a decree which shall not pass.\" \n                  Psalm 119:89-91; 135:6; 148:5, 6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 416}
