{"word": "The mighty power that works through all nature and sustains all things is not, as some men of science represent, merely an all-pervading principle, an actuating energy. God is a Spirit; yet He is a personal Being; for so He has revealed Himself: \n\n\n     \"The Lord is the true God, \n      He is the living God, and an everlasting King: . . . \n      The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, \n      Even they shall perish from the earth, and from under \n           these heavens.\" \n\n\n     \"The portion of Jacob is not like them: \n      For He is the former of all things.\" \n\n\n\n\n     \"He hath made the earth by His power, \n      He hath established the world by His wisdom, \n      And hath stretched out the heavens by His discretion.\" \n                              Jeremiah 10:10, 11, 16, 12.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 413}
