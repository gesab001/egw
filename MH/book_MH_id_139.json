{"word": "In some instances of healing, Jesus did not at once grant the blessing sought. But in the case of leprosy no sooner was the appeal made than it was granted. When we pray for earthly blessings, the answer to our prayer may be delayed, or God may give us something other than we ask; but not so when we ask for deliverance from sin. It is His will to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children, and to enable us to live a holy life. Christ \"gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father.\" Galatians 1:4. \"And this is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.\" 1 John 5:14, 15. \n                                                                           71", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 70}
