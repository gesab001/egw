{"word": "In the same way every human being can come to Christ. \"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us.\" Titus 3:5. Do you feel that because you are a sinner you cannot hope to receive blessing from God? Remember that Christ came into the world to save sinners. We have nothing to recommend us to God; the plea that we may urge now and ever is our utterly helpless condition, which makes His redeeming power a necessity. Renouncing all self-dependence, we may look to the cross of Calvary and say: \n\n\n     \"In my hand no price I bring; \n      Simply to Thy cross I cling.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 65}
