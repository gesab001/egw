{"word": "In the home of the paralytic there was great rejoicing when he returned to his family, carrying with ease the couch upon which he had been slowly borne from their presence but a short time before. They gathered round with tears of joy, hardly daring to believe their eyes. He stood before them in the full vigor of manhood. Those arms that they had seen lifeless were quick to obey his will. The flesh that had been shrunken and leaden-hued was now fresh and ruddy. He walked with a firm, free step. Joy and hope were written in every lineament of his countenance, and an expression of purity and peace had taken the place of the marks of sin and suffering. Glad thanksgiving went up from that home, and God was glorified through His Son, who had restored hope to the hopeless and strength to the stricken one. This man and his family were ready to lay down their lives for Jesus. No doubt dimmed their faith, no unbelief marred their fealty to Him who had brought light into their darkened home. \n\n\n     \"Bless the Lord, O my soul: \n      And all that is within me, bless His holy name. \n      Bless the Lord, O my soul, \n      And forget not all His benefits: \n      Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; \n      Who healeth all thy diseases; \n      Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;... \n      So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. \n      The Lord executeth righteousness \n      And judgment for all that are oppressed.... \n      He hath not dealt with us after our sins; \n      Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.... \n      Like as a father pitieth his children, \n      So the Lord pitieth them that fear Him. \n      For He knoweth our frame; \n      He remembereth that we are dust.\" \n                           Psalm 103:1-14. \n                                                                           81", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 79}
