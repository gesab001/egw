{"word": "The Joy of the Lord \n\n     There were ninety and nine that safely lay \n       In the shelter of the fold, \n     But one was out on the hills away, \n       Far, far from the gates of gold-- \n     Away on the mountains wild and bare, \n     Away from the tender Shepherd's care. \n\n\n     \"Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine; \n       Are they not enough for Thee?\" \n     But the Shepherd made answer: \"One of Mine \n       Has wandered away from Me, \n     And although the road be rough and steep, \n     I go to the desert to find My sheep.\" \n\n\n     But none of the ransomed ever knew \n       How deep were the waters crossed, \n     Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed \n           through \n       Ere He found His sheep that was lost. \n     Far out in the desert He heard its cry-- \n     Fainting and helpless, and ready to die. \n\n\n     \"Lord, whence are these blood drops all the way \n       That mark out the mountain's track?\" \n     \"They were shed for one who had gone astray, \n       Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.\" \n     \"Lord, why are Thy hands so rent and torn?\" \n     \"They were pierced tonight by many a thorn.\" \n\n\n     But all through the mountains, thunder-riven, \n       And up from the rocky steep, \n     There rose a cry to the gate of heaven, \n       \"Rejoice, I have found My sheep!\" \n     And the angels sang around the throne, \n     \"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!\" \n                        --Elizabeth C. Clephane. \n                                                                           506\nBut the day is coming when the battle will have been fought, the victory won. The will of God is to be done on earth as it is done in heaven. The nations of the saved will know no other law than the law of heaven. All will be a happy, united family, clothed with the garments of praise and thanksgiving --the robe of Christ's righteousness. All nature, in its surpassing loveliness, will offer to God a tribute of praise and adoration. The world will be bathed in the light of heaven. The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold greater than it is now. The years will move on in gladness. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, the sons of God will shout for joy, while God and Christ will unite in proclaiming, \"There shall be no more sin, neither shall there be any more death.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 505}
