{"word": "Paul wrote to these brethren as \"saints in Christ Jesus;\" but he was not writing to those who were perfect in character. He wrote to them as men and women who were striving against temptation and who were in danger of falling. He pointed them to \"the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that Great Shepherd of the sheep.\" He assured them that \"through the blood of the everlasting covenant\" He will \"make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that which is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ.\" Hebrews 13:20, 21.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 167}
