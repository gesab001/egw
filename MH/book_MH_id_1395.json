{"word": "If impatient words are spoken to you, never reply in the same spirit. Remember that \"a soft answer turneth away wrath.\" Proverbs 15:1. And there is wonderful power in silence. Words spoken in reply to one who is angry sometimes serve only to exasperate. But anger met with silence, in a tender, forbearing spirit, quickly dies away.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 486}
