{"word": "The Saviour's example is to be the standard of our service for the tempted and the erring. The same interest and tenderness and long-suffering that He has manifested toward us, we are to manifest toward others. \"As I have loved you,\" He says, \"that ye also love one another.\" John 13:34. If Christ dwells in us, we shall reveal His unselfish love toward all with whom we have to do. As we see men and women in need of sympathy and help, we shall not ask, \"Are they worthy?\" but \"How can I benefit them?\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 162}
