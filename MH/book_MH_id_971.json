{"word": "Chap. 28 - Ministry of the Home\n\n     The restoration and uplifting of humanity begins in the home. The work of parents underlies every other. Society is composed of families, and is what the heads of families make it. Out of the heart are \"the issues of life\" (Proverbs 4:23); and the heart of the community, of the church, and of the nation is the household. The well-being of society, the success of the church, the prosperity of the nation, depend upon home influences.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 349}
