{"word": "Intoxicating Drinks \n\n     \"Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: \n      And whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.\" \n     \"Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? \n          who hath babbling? who hath wounds \n          without cause? \n      Who hath redness of eyes? \n      They that tarry long at the wine; \n      They that go to seek mixed wine. \n      Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, \n      When it giveth his color in the cup, \n      When it moveth itself aright. \n      At the last it biteth like a serpent, \n      And stingeth like an adder.\" \n                           Proverbs 20:1; 23:29-32. \n\n\n     Never was traced by human hand a more vivid picture of the debasement and the slavery of the victim of intoxicating drink. Enthralled, degraded, even when awakened to a sense of his misery, he has no power to break from the snare; he \"will seek it yet again.\" Verse 35. \n                                                                           331", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 330}
