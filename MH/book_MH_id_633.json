{"word": "God is just as willing to restore the sick to health now as when the Holy Spirit spoke these words through the psalmist. And Christ is the same compassionate physician now that He was during His earthly ministry. In Him there is healing balm for every disease, restoring power for every infirmity. His disciples in this time are to pray for the sick as verily as the disciples of old prayed. And recoveries will follow; for \"the prayer of faith shall save the sick.\" We have the Holy Spirit's power, the calm assurance of faith, that can claim God's promises. The Lord's promise, \"They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover\" (Mark 16:18), is just as trustworthy now as in the days of the apostles. It presents the privilege of God's children, and our faith should lay hold of all that it embraces. Christ's servants are the channel of His working, and through them He desires to exercise His healing power. It is our work to present the sick and suffering to God in the arms of our faith. We should teach them to believe in the Great Healer.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 226}
