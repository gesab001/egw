{"word": "To the curious crowd pressing about Jesus there was imparted no vital power. But the suffering woman who touched Him in faith received healing. So in spiritual things does the casual contact differ from the touch of faith. To believe in Christ merely as the Saviour of the world can never bring healing to the soul. The faith that is unto salvation is not a mere assent to the truth of the gospel. True faith is that which receives Christ as a personal Saviour. God gave His only-begotten Son, that I, by believing in Him, \"should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16. When I come to Christ, according to His word, I am to believe that I receive His saving grace. The life that I now live, I am to \"live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.\" Galatians 2:20.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 62}
