{"word": "No one can practice real benevolence without self-denial. Only by a life of simplicity, self-denial, and close economy is it possible for us to accomplish the work appointed us as Christ's representatives. Pride and worldly ambition must be put out of our hearts. In all our work the principle of unselfishness revealed in Christ's life is to be carried out. Upon the walls of our homes, the pictures, the furnishings, we are to read, \"Bring the poor that are cast out to thy house.\" On our wardrobes we are to see written, as with the finger of God, \"Clothe the naked.\" In the dining room, on the table laden with abundant food, we should see traced, \"Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry?\" Isaiah 58:7.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 206}
