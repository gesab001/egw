{"word": "Men and women can reach God's ideal for them if they will take Christ as their helper. What human wisdom cannot do, His grace will accomplish for those who give themselves to Him in loving trust. His providence can unite hearts in bonds that are of heavenly origin. Love will not be a mere exchange of soft and flattering words. The loom of heaven weaves with warp and woof finer, yet more firm, than can be woven by the looms of earth. The result is not a tissue fabric, but a texture that will bear wear and test and trial. Heart will be bound to heart in the golden bonds of a love that is enduring. \n\n\n     Better than gold is a peaceful home, \n     Where all the fireside charities come; \n     The shrine of love and the heaven of life, \n     Hallowed by mother, or sister, or wife. \n     However humble the home may be, \n     Or tried with sorrows by heaven's decree, \n     The blessings that never were bought or sold, \n     And center there, are better than gold. \n                                   Anon.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 362}
