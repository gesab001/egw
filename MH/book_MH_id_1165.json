In earth and sea and sky, with their marvelous tint and color, varying in gorgeous contrast or blended in harmony, we behold His glory. The everlasting hills tell us of His power. The trees that wave their green banners in the sunlight, and the flowers in their delicate beauty, point to their Creator. The living green that carpets the brown earth tells of God's care for the humblest of His creatures.

He who placed the pearls in the ocean and the amethyst and chrysolite among the rocks, is a lover of the beautiful. The sun rising in the heavens is a representative of Him who is the life and light of all that He has made. All the brightness and beauty that adorn the earth and light up the heavens, speak of God. \n\n\n     \"His glory covered the heavens.\" \n     \"The earth is full of Thy riches.\" \n\n\n     \"Day unto day uttereth speech, \n           And night unto night showeth knowledge. \n      There is no speech nor language, \n           Without these their voice is heard. \n      Their line is gone out through all the earth, \n           And their words to the end of the world.\" \n                        Habakkuk 3:3; Psalm 104:24; \n                                      19:2-4, margin.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 411}
