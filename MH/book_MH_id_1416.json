{"word": "Study carefully the divine-human character, and constantly inquire, \"What would Jesus do were He in my place?\" This should be the measurement of our duty. Do not place yourselves needlessly in the society of those who by their arts would weaken your purpose to do right, or bring a stain upon your conscience. Do nothing among strangers, in the street, on the cars, in the home, that would have the least appearance of evil. Do something every day to improve, beautify, and ennoble the life that Christ has purchased with His own blood.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 491}
