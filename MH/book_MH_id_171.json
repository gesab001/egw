{"word": "Jesus had given the palsied man no assurance of divine help. The man might have said, \"Lord, if Thou wilt make me whole, I will obey Thy word.\" He might have stopped to doubt, and thus have lost his one chance of healing. But no, he believed Christ's word, believed that he was made whole; immediately he made the effort, and God gave him the power; he willed to walk, and he did walk. Acting on the word of Christ, he was made whole.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 84}
