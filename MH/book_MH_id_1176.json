{"word": "It is not by inherent power that year by year the earth yields its bounties and continues its march around the sun. The hand of the Infinite One is perpetually at work guiding this planet. It is God's power continually exercised that keeps the earth in position in its rotation. It is God who causes the sun to rise in the heavens. He opens the windows of heaven and gives rain. \n\n\n     \"He giveth snow like wool: \n      He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.\" \n\n\n     \"When He uttereth His voice, there is a multitude of waters \n            in the heavens, \n      And He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the \n            earth; \n      He maketh lightnings with rain, \n      And bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures.\" \n                         Psalm 147:16; Jeremiah 10:13.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 416}
