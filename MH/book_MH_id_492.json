He may say: \n\n\n     \"I will look unto the Lord; \n      I will wait for the God of my salvation: \n      My God will hear me. \n      Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: \n      When I fall, I shall arise; \n      When I sit in darkness, \n      The Lord shall be a light unto me.\" \n                        Micah 7:7, 8. \n\n\n     \"He will again have compassion on us, \n      He will blot out our iniquities; \n      Yea, Thou wilt cast all our sins into the depths of the sea!\" \n                               Micah 7:19, Noyes.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 182}
