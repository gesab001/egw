{"word": "Said the tried apostle Paul: \"He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for My strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.\" 2 Corinthians 12:9, 10.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 482}
