{"word": "The Scripture bids us, \"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.\" James 5:16. To the one asking for prayer, let thoughts like these be presented: \"We cannot read the heart, or know the secrets of your life. These are known only to yourself and to God. If you repent of your sins, it is your duty to make confession of them.\" Sin of a private character is to be confessed to Christ, the only mediator between God and man. For \"if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\" 1 John 2:1. Every sin is an offense against God \n                                                                           229\nand is to be confessed to Him through Christ. Every open sin should be as openly confessed. Wrong done to a fellow being should be made right with the one who has been offended. If any who are seeking health have been guilty of evilspeaking, if they have sowed discord in the home, the neighborhood, or the church, and have stirred up alienation and dissension, if by any wrong practice they have led others into sin, these things should be confessed before God and before those who have been offended. \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" 1 John 1:9.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 228}
