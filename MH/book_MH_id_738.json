{"word": "The Circulation of the Blood \n\n     In order to have good health, we must have good blood; for the blood is the current of life. It repairs waste and nourishes the body. When supplied with the proper food elements and when cleansed and vitalized by contact with pure air, it carries life and vigor to every part of the system. The more perfect the circulation, the better will this work be accomplished.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 271}
