{"word": "\"They which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize.\" 1 Corinthians 9:24. In the warfare in which we are engaged, all may win who will discipline themselves by obedience to right principles. The practice of these principles in the details of life is too often looked upon as unimportant --a matter too trivial to demand attention. But in view of the issues at stake, nothing with which we have to do is small. Every act casts its weight into the scale that determines life's victory or defeat. The scripture bids us, \"So run, that ye may obtain.\" Verse 24.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 129}
