{"word": "The tissues of the swine swarm with parasites. Of the swine God said, \"It is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.\" Deuteronomy 14:8. \n                                                                           314\nThis command was given because swine's flesh is unfit for food. Swine are scavengers, and this is the only use they were intended to serve. Never, under any circumstances, was their flesh to be eaten by human beings. It is impossible for the flesh of any living creature to be wholesome when filth is its natural element and when it feeds upon every detestable thing.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 313}
