{"word": "It required nothing less than creative power to restore health to that decaying body. The same voice that spoke life to man created from the dust of the earth, had spoken life to the dying paralytic. And the same power that gave life to the body had renewed the heart. He who at creation \"spake, and it was,\" who \"commanded, and it stood fast\" (Psalm 33:9), had spoken life to the soul dead in trespasses and sins. The healing of the body was an evidence of the power that had renewed the heart. Christ bade the paralytic arise and walk, \"that ye may know,\" He said, \"that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 77}
