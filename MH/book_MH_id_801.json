{"word": "\"Why are ye anxious concerning raiment? . . . If God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not much more clothe you? . . . Be not therefore anxious, saying, . . . Wherewithal shall we be clothed? . . . For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first His kingdom, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" Matthew 6:28-33, R.V.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 289}
