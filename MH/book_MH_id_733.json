{"word": "Out of doors, amid the things that God has made, breathing the fresh, health-giving air, the sick can best be told of the new life in Christ. Here God's word can be read. Here the light of Christ's righteousness can shine into hearts darkened by sin. \n                                                                           267\n\n     O, could I find, from day to day, \n        A nearness to my God, \n     Then would my hours glide sweet away, \n        While leaning on His word. \n\n\n     Lord, I desire with Thee to live \n        Anew from day to day, \n     In joys the world can never give, \n        Nor ever take away. \n\n\n     Blest Jesus, come, and rule my heart, \n        And make me wholly Thine, \n     That I may nevermore depart, \n        Nor grieve Thy love divine. \n                 --Benjamin Cleveland.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 266}
