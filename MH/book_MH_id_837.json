{"word": "Preparation of Food \n\n     It is wrong to eat merely to gratify the appetite, but no indifference should be manifested regarding the quality of the food or the manner of its preparation. If the food eaten is not relished, the body will not be so well nourished. The food should be carefully chosen and prepared with intelligence and skill.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 300}
