{"word": "These theories, followed to their logical conclusion, sweep away the whole Christian economy. They do away with the necessity for the atonement and make man his own savior. \n                                                                           429\nThese theories regarding God make His word of no effect, and those who accept them are in great danger of being led finally to look upon the whole Bible as a fiction. They may regard virtue as better than vice; but, having shut out God from His rightful position of sovereignty, they place their dependence upon human power, which, without God, is worthless. The unaided human will has no real power to resist and overcome evil. The defenses of the soul are broken down. Man has no barrier against sin. When once the restraints of God's word and His Spirit are rejected, we know not to what depths one may sink. \n\n\n     \"Every word of God is pure: \n      He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him. \n      Add thou not unto His words, \n      Lest He reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.\" \n\n\n     \"His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, \n      And he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.\" \n                            Proverbs 30:5, 6; 5:22.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 428}
