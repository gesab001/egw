{"word": "Above all other places having to do with secular interests only, legislative halls and courts of justice should be free from the curse of intemperance. Governors, senators, representatives, judges, men who enact and administer a nation's laws, men who hold in their hands the lives, the fair fame, the possessions of their fellows, should be men of strict temperance. Only thus can their minds be clear to discriminate between right and wrong. Only thus can they possess firmness of principle, and wisdom to administer justice and to show mercy. But how does the record stand? How many of these men have their minds beclouded, their sense of right and wrong confused, by strong drink! How many are the oppressive \n                                                                           346\nlaws enacted, how many the innocent persons condemned to death, through the injustice of drinking lawmakers, witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and even judges! Many there are, \"mighty to drink wine,\" and \"men of strength to mingle strong drink,\" \"that call evil good, and good evil;\" that \"justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!\" Of such God says: \n\n\n     \"Woe unto them. . . . \n      As the fire devoureth the stubble, \n      And the flame consumeth the chaff, \n      So their root shall be as rottenness, \n      And their blossom shall go up as dust: \n      Because they have cast away the law of the Lord of \n           hosts, \n      And despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.\" \n                                     Isaiah 5:22-24.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 345}
