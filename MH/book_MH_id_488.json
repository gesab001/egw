{"word": "The Saviour overcame to show man how he may overcome. All the temptations of Satan, Christ met with the word of God. By trusting in God's promises, He received power to obey God's commandments, and the tempter could gain no advantage. To every temptation His answer was, \"It is written.\" So God has given us His word wherewith to resist evil. Exceeding great and precious promises are ours, that by these we \"might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\" 2 Peter 1:4.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 181}
