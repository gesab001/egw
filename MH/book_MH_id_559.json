{"word": "Chap. 13 - The Helpless Poor\n\n     When all has been done that can be done in helping the poor to help themselves, there still remain the widow and the fatherless, the aged, the helpless, and the sick, that claim sympathy and care. Never should these be neglected. They are committed by God Himself to the mercy, the love, and the tender care of all whom He has made His stewards.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 201}
