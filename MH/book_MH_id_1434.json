{"word": "Chap. 42 - Development and Service\n\n     Christian life is more than many take it to be. It does not consist wholly in gentleness, patience, meekness, and kindliness. These graces are essential; but there is need also of courage, force, energy, and perseverance. The path that Christ marks out is a narrow, self-denying path. To enter that path and press on through difficulties and discouragements requires men who are more than weaklings.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 497}
