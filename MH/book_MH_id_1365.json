{"word": "We need to beware of self-pity. Never indulge the feeling that you are not esteemed as you should be, that your efforts are not appreciated, that your work is too difficult. Let the memory of what Christ has endured for us silence every murmuring thought. We are treated better than was our Lord. \"Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not.\" Jeremiah 45:5. The Lord has no place in His work for those who have a greater desire to win the crown than to bear the cross. He wants men who are more intent upon doing their duty \n                                                                           477\nthan upon receiving their reward--men who are more solicitous for principle than for promotion.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 476}
