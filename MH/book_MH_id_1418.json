{"word": "We need a constant sense of the ennobling power of pure thoughts. The only security for any soul is right thinking. As a man \"thinketh in his heart, so is he.\" Proverbs 23:7. The power of self-restraint strengthens by exercise. That which at first seems difficult, by constant repetition grows easy, until right thoughts and actions become habitual. If we will we may turn away from all that is cheap and inferior, and rise to a high standard; we may be respected by men and beloved of God. \n                                                                           492", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 491}
