{"word": "Parents, let your children see that you love them and will do all in your power to make them happy. If you do so, your necessary restrictions will have far greater weight in their young minds. Rule your children with tenderness and compassion, remembering that \"their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\" Matthew 18:10. If you desire the angels to do for your children the work given them of God, co-operate with them by doing your part.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 394}
