{"word": "Let mothers come to Jesus with their perplexities. They will find grace sufficient to aid them in the care of their children. The gates are open for every mother who would lay her burdens at the Saviour's feet. He who said, \"Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not\" (Mark 10:14), still invites mothers to bring their little ones to be blessed by Him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 42}
