{"word": "Saved by Hope \n\n     \"We are saved by hope.\" Romans 8:24. The fallen must be led to feel that it is not too late for them to be men. Christ honored man with His confidence and thus placed him on his honor. Even those who had fallen the lowest He treated with respect. It was a continual pain to Christ to be brought into contact with enmity, depravity, and impurity; but never did He utter one expression to show that His sensibilities were shocked or His refined tastes offended. Whatever the evil habits, the strong prejudices, or the overbearing passions of human beings, He met them all with pitying tenderness. As we partake of His Spirit, we shall regard all men as brethren, with similar temptations and trials, often falling and struggling to rise again, battling with discouragements and difficulties, craving sympathy and help. Then we shall meet them in such a way as not to discourage or repel them, but to awaken hope in their hearts. As they are thus encouraged, \n                                                                           166\nthey can say with confidence, \"Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.\" He will \"plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold His righteousness.\" Micah 7:8, 9. \n\n\n     God \"looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. \n     He fashioneth their hearts alike.\" \n                                     Psalm 33:14, 15.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 165}
