{"word": "There are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care because they seek to reach the world's standard. They have chosen its service, accepted its perplexities, adopted its customs. Thus their character is marred and their life made a weariness. The continual worry is wearing out the life forces. Our Lord desires them to lay aside this yoke of bondage. He invites them to accept His yoke; He says, \"My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\" Worry is blind and cannot discern the future; but Jesus sees the end from the beginning. In every difficulty He has His way prepared to bring relief. \"No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.\" Matthew 11:30; Psalm 84:11.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 481}
