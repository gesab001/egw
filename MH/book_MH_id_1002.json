{"word": "\"A prudent wife is from the Lord.\" \"The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her. . . . She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.\" \"She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her,\" saying, \"Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.\" He who gains such a wife \"findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favor of the Lord.\" Proverbs 19:14; 31:11, 12, 26-29; 18:22.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 359}
