{"word": "Chap. 43 - A Higher Experience\n\n     We need constantly a fresh revelation of Christ, a daily experience that harmonizes with His teachings. High and holy attainments are within our reach. Continual progress in knowledge and virtue is God's purpose for us. His law is the echo of His own voice, giving to all the invitation, \"Come up higher. Be holy, holier still.\" Every day we may advance in perfection of Christian character.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 503}
