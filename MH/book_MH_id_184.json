{"word": "The woman had stood before Jesus, cowering with fear. His words, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone,\" had come to her as a death sentence. She dared not lift her eyes to the Saviour's face, but silently awaited her doom. In astonishment she saw her accusers depart speechless and confounded; then those words of hope fell upon her ear, \"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\" Her heart was melted, and, casting herself at the feet of Jesus, she sobbed out her grateful love and with bitter tears confessed her sins.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 89}
