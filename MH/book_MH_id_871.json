{"word": "Our bodies are Christ's purchased possession, and we are not at liberty to do with them as we please. All who understand the laws of health should realize their obligation to obey these laws which God has established in their being. Obedience to the laws of health is to be made a matter of personal duty. We ourselves must suffer the results of violated law. We must individually answer to God for our habits and practices. Therefore the question with us is not, \"What is the world's practice?\" but, \"How shall I as an individual treat the habitation that God has given me?\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 310}
