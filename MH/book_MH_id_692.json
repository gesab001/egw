{"word": "Abiding peace, true rest of spirit, has but one Source. It was of this that Christ spoke when He said, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" Matthew 11:28. \"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.\" John 14:27. This peace is not something that He gives apart from Himself. It is in Christ, and we can receive it only by receiving Him.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 247}
