{"word": "Chap. 10 - Helping the Tempted\n\n     Not because we first loved Him did Christ love us; but \"while we were yet sinners\" He died for us. He does not treat us according to our desert. Although our sins have merited condemnation, He does not condemn us. Year after year He has borne with our weakness and ignorance, with our ingratitude and waywardness. Notwithstanding our wanderings, our hardness of heart, our neglect of His Holy Word, His hand is stretched out still.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 161}
