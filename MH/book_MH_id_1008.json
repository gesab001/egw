{"word": "Neither the husband nor the wife should merge his or her individuality in that of the other. Each has a personal relation to God. Of Him each is to ask, \"What is right?\" \"What is wrong?\" \"How may I best fulfill life's purpose?\" Let the wealth of your affection flow forth to Him who gave His life for you. Make Christ first and last and best in everything. As your love for Him becomes deeper and stronger, your love for each other will be purified and strengthened.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 361}
