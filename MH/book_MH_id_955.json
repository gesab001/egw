{"word": "But above the tribunal of the church is the tribunal of God. He who declared to the first murderer, \"The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground\" (Genesis 4:10), will not accept for His altar the gifts of the liquor dealer. His anger is kindled against those who attempt to cover their guilt with a cloak of liberality. Their money is stained with blood. A curse is upon it. \n                                                                           341\n\n     \"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices \n           unto Me? saith the Lord. . . . \n      When ye come to appear before Me, \n      Who hath required this at your hand, to tread My courts? \n      Bring no more vain oblation . . . . \n      When ye spread forth your hands, \n      I will hide Mine eyes from you: \n      Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: \n      Your hands are full of blood.\" \n                                 Isaiah 1:11-15.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 340}
