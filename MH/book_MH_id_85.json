{"word": "Jesus was an earnest, constant worker. Never lived there among men another so weighted with responsibilities. Never another carried so heavy a burden of the world's sorrow and sin. Never another toiled with such self-consuming zeal for the good of men. Yet His was a life of health. Physically as well as spiritually He was represented by the sacrificial lamb, \"without blemish and without spot.\" 1 Peter 1:19. In body as in soul He was an example of what God designed all humanity to be through obedience to His laws.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 51}
