{"word": "Chap. 8 - The Physician, an Educator\n\n     The true physician is an educator. He recognizes his responsibility, not only to the sick who are under his direct care, but also to the community in which he lives. He stands as a guardian of both physical and moral health. It is his endeavor not only to teach right methods for the treatment of the sick, but to encourage right habits of living, and to spread a knowledge of right principles.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 125}
