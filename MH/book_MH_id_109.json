{"word": "Looking toward the woman, Christ insisted on knowing who had touched Him. Finding concealment vain, she came forward trembling, and cast herself at His feet. With grateful tears she told Him, before all the people, why she had touched His garment, and how she had been immediately healed. She feared that her act in touching His garment had been one of presumption; but no word of censure came from Christ's lips. He spoke only words of approval. They came from a heart of love, filled with sympathy for human woe. \"Daughter,\" He said gently, \"be of good comfort: thy faith \n                                                                           62\nhath made thee whole; go in peace.\" Verse 48. How cheering were these words to her. Now no fear that she had given offense embittered her joy.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 61}
