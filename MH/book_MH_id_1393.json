Whatever others may think of us or do to us, it need not disturb our oneness with Christ, the fellowship of the Spirit. \"What glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.\" 1 Peter 2:20.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 485}
