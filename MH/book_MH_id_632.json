{"word": "Chap. 16 - Prayer for the Sick\n\n     The Scripture says that \"men ought always to pray, and not to faint\" (Luke 18:1); and if ever there is a time when they feel their need of prayer, it is when strength fails and life itself seems slipping from their grasp. Often those who are in health forget the wonderful mercies continued to them day by day, year after year, and they render no tribute of praise to God for His benefits. But when sickness comes, God is remembered. When human strength fails, men feel their need of divine help. And never does our merciful God turn from the soul that in sincerity seeks Him for help. He is our refuge in sickness as in health. \n\n\n     \"Like as a father pitieth his children, \n          So the Lord pitieth them that fear Him. \n      For He knoweth our frame; \n          He remembereth that we are dust.\" \n                         Psalm 103:13, 14. \n\n\n     \"Because of their transgression, \n      And because of their iniquities, [men] are afflicted. \n      Their soul abhorreth all manner of food; \n      And they draw near unto the gates of death.\" \n                         Psalm 107:17, 18, A.R.V. \n\n\n     \"Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, \n      And He saveth them out of their distresses. \n      He sendeth His word, and healeth them, \n      And delivereth them from their destructions.\" \n                               Verses 19, 20, R.V. \n                                                                           226", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 225}
