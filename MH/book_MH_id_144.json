{"word": "The Elder Brother of our race is by the eternal throne. He looks upon every soul who is turning his face toward Him as the Saviour. He knows by experience what are the weaknesses of humanity, what are our wants, and where lies the strength of our temptations; for He was \"in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\" Hebrews 4:15. He is watching over you, trembling child of God. Are you tempted? He will deliver. Are you weak? He will strengthen. Are you ignorant? He will enlighten. Are you wounded? He will heal. The Lord \"telleth the number of the stars;\" and yet \"He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.\" Psalm 147:4, 3. \n                                                                           72", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 71}
