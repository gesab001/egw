{"word": "Man cannot by searching find out God. Let none seek with presumptuous hand to lift the veil that conceals His glory. \"Unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out.\" Romans 11:33. It is a proof of His mercy that there is the hiding of His power; for to lift the veil that conceals the divine presence is death. No mortal mind can penetrate the secrecy in which the Mighty One dwells and works. Only that which He sees fit to reveal can we comprehend of Him. Reason must acknowledge an authority superior to itself. Heart and intellect must bow to the great I AM.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 438}
