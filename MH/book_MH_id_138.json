{"word": "When this man came to Jesus, he was \"full of leprosy,\" Its deadly poison permeated his whole body. The disciples sought to prevent their Master from touching him; for he who touched a leper became himself unclean. But in laying His hand upon the leper, Jesus received no defilement. The leprosy was cleansed. Thus it is with the leprosy of sin-- deep-rooted, deadly, impossible to be cleansed by human power. \"The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores.\" Isaiah 1:5, 6. But Jesus, coming to dwell in humanity, receives no pollution. His presence was healing virtue for the sinner. Whoever will fall at His feet, saying in faith, \"Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean,\" shall hear the answer, \"I will; be thou clean.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 70}
