{"word": "One mother with her child had left her home to find Jesus. On the way she told a neighbor her errand, and the neighbor wished to have Jesus bless her children. Thus several mothers came here together, with their little ones. Some of the children had passed beyond the years of infancy to childhood and youth. When the mothers made known their desire, Jesus heard with sympathy the timid, tearful request. But He waited to see how the disciples would treat them. When He saw the disciples reproving the mothers and sending them away, thinking to do Him a favor, He showed them their error, saying, \"Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\" Mark 10:14. He took the children in His arms, He laid His hands upon them, and gave them the blessings for which they came.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 41}
