And if the man . . . himself be able to redeem it; . . . he may return unto his possession. But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee.\" Leviticus 25:23-28.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 184}
