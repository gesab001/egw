{"word": "When wrongs have been righted, we may present the needs of the sick to the Lord in calm faith, as His Spirit may indicate. He knows each individual by name, and cares for each as if there were not another upon the earth for whom He gave His beloved Son. Because God's love is so great and so unfailing, the sick should be encouraged to trust in Him and be cheerful. To be anxious about themselves tends to cause weakness and disease. If they will rise above depression and gloom, their prospect of recovery will be better; for \"the eye of the Lord is upon them\" \"that hope in His mercy.\" Psalm 33:18.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 229}
