{"word": "The conduct of David toward Saul has a lesson. By command of God, Saul had been anointed as king over Israel. Because of his disobedience the Lord declared that the kingdom should be taken from him; and yet how tender and courteous and forbearing was the conduct of David toward him! In seeking the life of David, Saul came into the wilderness and, unattended, entered the very cave where David with his men of war lay hidden. \"And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, . . . \n                                                                           485\nI will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. . . . And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.\" The Saviour bids us, \"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" Remember that soon your life record will pass in review before God. Remember, too, that He has said, \"Thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: . . . for thou that judgest doest the same things.\" 1 Samuel 24:4-6; Matthew 7:1, 2; Romans 2:1.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 484}
