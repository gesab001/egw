{"word": "The honor of God, the stability of the nation, the well-being of the community, of the home, and of the individual, demand that every possible effort be made in arousing the people to the evil of intemperance. Soon we shall see the result of this terrible evil as we do not see it now. Who will put forth a determined effort to stay the work of destruction? As yet the contest has hardly begun. Let an army be formed to stop the sale of the drugged liquors that are making men mad. Let the danger from the liquor traffic be made plain and a public sentiment be created that shall demand its prohibition. Let the drink-maddened men be given an opportunity to escape from their thralldom. Let the voice of the nation demand of its lawmakers that a stop be put to this infamous traffic. \n\n\n     \"If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, \n      And those that are ready to be slain; \n      If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; \n      Doth not He that pondereth the heart consider it? \n      And He that keepeth thy soul, doth not He know it?\" \n      And \"what wilt thou say when He shall punish thee?\" \n                     Proverbs 24:11, 12; Jeremiah 13:21.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 346}
