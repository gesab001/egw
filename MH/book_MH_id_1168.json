{"word": "Nature Is Not God \n\n     God's handiwork in nature is not God Himself in nature. The things of nature are an expression of God's character and power; but we are not to regard nature as God. The artistic skill of human beings produces very beautiful workmanship, things that delight the eye, and these things reveal to us something of the thought of the designer; but the thing made is not the maker. It is not the work, but the workman, that is counted worthy of honor. So while nature is an expression of God's thought, it is not nature, but the God of nature, that is to be exalted. \n\n\n     \"Let us worship and bow down: \n          Let us kneel before the Lord.\" \n     \"In His hand are the deep places of the earth; \n          The heights of the mountains are His also. \n      The sea is His, and He made it; \n          And His hands formed the dry land.\" \n                         Psalm 95:6; 95:4, 5, A.R.V. \n                                                                           414\n\n     \"Seek Him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, \n      And turneth the shadow of death into the morning, \n      And maketh the day dark with night;\" \n     \"He that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, \n      And declareth unto man what is His thought;\" \n     \"He that buildeth His spheres in the heaven, \n      And hath founded His arch [Noyes's translation] \n          in the earth;\" \n     \"He that calleth for the waters of the sea, \n      And poureth them out upon the face of the earth; \n        Jehovah is His name.\" \n                         Amos 5:8, A.R.V.; 4:13, A.R.V.; \n                              9:6, margin; 9:6, A.R.V.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 413}
