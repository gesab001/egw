{"word": "What is the condition in the world today? Is not faith in the Bible as effectually destroyed by the higher criticism and speculation of today as it was by tradition and rabbinism in the days of Christ? Have not greed and ambition and love of pleasure as strong a hold on men's hearts now as they had then? In the professedly Christian world, even in the professed churches of Christ, how few are governed by Christian principles. In business, social, domestic, even religious circles, how few make the teachings of Christ the rule of daily living. Is it not true that \"justice standeth afar off: . . . equity cannot enter. . . . And he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey\"? Isaiah 59:14, 15.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 142}
