{"word": "When the disciples heard the Saviour's direction, \"Give ye them to eat,\" all the difficulties arose in their minds. They questioned, \"Shall we go into the villages to buy food?\" But what said Christ? \"Give ye them to eat.\" The disciples brought to Jesus all they had; but He did not invite them to eat. He bade them serve the people. The food multiplied in His hands, and the hands of the disciples, reaching out to Christ, were never unfilled. The little store was sufficient for all. When the multitude had been fed, the disciples ate with Jesus of the precious, heaven-supplied food.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 49}
