He has seen his own children besotted and ruined. Lawlessness runs riot. Property is in danger. Life is unsafe. Accidents by sea and by land multiply.

Vices fostered by the children of debauchery and crime infect the sons and daughters of refined and cultured households.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 345}
