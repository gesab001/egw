{"word": "After the multitude had been fed, there was an abundance of food left. Jesus bade His disciples, \"Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\" John 6:12. These words meant more than putting the food into baskets. The lesson was twofold. Nothing is to be wasted. We are to let slip no temporal advantage. We should neglect nothing that would serve to benefit a human being. Let everything be gathered up that will relieve the necessities of earth's hungry ones. With the same carefulness are we to treasure the bread from heaven to satisfy the needs of the soul. By every word of God we are to live. Nothing that God has spoken is to be lost. Not one word that concerns our eternal salvation are we to neglect. Not one word is to fall useless to the ground.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "MH", "page": 48}
