{"word": "The appointed ministers of the sanctuary, the Levites received no landed inheritance; they dwelt together in cities set apart for their use, and received their support from the tithes and the gifts and offerings devoted to God's service. They were the teachers of the people, guests at all their festivities, and everywhere honored as servants and representatives of God. To the whole nation was given the command: \"Take heed to thyself that \n                                                                           149\nthou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.\" \"Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance.\" Deuteronomy 12:19; 10:9.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 148}
