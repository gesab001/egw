{"word": "As a relaxation from study, occupations pursued in the open air, and affording exercise for the whole body, are the most beneficial. No line of manual training is of more value than agriculture. A greater effort should be made to create and to encourage an interest in agricultural pursuits. Let the teacher call attention to what the Bible says about agriculture: that it was God's plan for man to till the earth; that the first man, the ruler of the whole world, was given a garden to cultivate; and that many of the world's greatest men, its real nobility, have been tillers of the soil. Show the opportunities in such a life. The wise man says, \"The king himself is served by the field.\" Ecclesiastes 5:9. Of him who cultivates the soil the Bible declares, \"His God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.\" Isaiah 28:26. And again, \"Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof.\" Proverbs 27:18. He who earns his livelihood by agriculture escapes many temptations and enjoys unnumbered privileges and blessings denied to those whose work lies in the great cities. And in these days of mammoth trusts and business competition, there are few who enjoy so real an independence and so great certainty of fair return for their labor as does the tiller of the soil.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 219}
