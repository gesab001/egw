Spent with grief and the weariness of his flight, he with his company had tarried beside the Jordan for a few hours' rest. He was awakened by the summons to immediate flight. In the darkness, the passage of the deep and swift-flowing stream must be made by that whole company of men, women, \n                                                                           165\nand little children; for hard after them were the forces of the traitor son. \n      In that hour of darkest trial, David sang: \n\n     \"I cried unto the Lord with my voice, \n      And He heard me out of His holy hill. \n\n     \"I laid me down and slept; \n             I awaked; for the Lord sustained me. \n      I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, \n             That have set themselves against me around about.\" \n                                             Psalm 3:4-6.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 164}
