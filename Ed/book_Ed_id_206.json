{"word": "In every human being He discerned infinite possibilities. He saw men as they might be, transfigured by His grace--in \"the beauty of the Lord our God.\" Psalm 90:17. Looking upon them with hope, He inspired hope. Meeting them with confidence, He inspired trust. Revealing in Himself man's true ideal, He awakened, for its attainment, both desire and faith. In His presence souls despised and fallen realized that they still were men, and they longed to prove themselves worthy of His regard. In many a heart that seemed dead to all things holy, were awakened new impulses. To many a despairing one there opened the possibility of a new life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 80}
