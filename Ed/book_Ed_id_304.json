{"word": "The harvest is a reproduction of the seed sown. Every seed yields fruit after its kind. So it is with the traits of character we cherish. Selfishness, self-love, self-esteem, self-indulgence, reproduce themselves, and the end is wretchedness and ruin. \"He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.\" Galatians 6:8. Love, sympathy, and kindness yield fruitage of blessing, a harvest that is imperishable.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 109}
