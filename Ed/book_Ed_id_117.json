{"word": "The secret of Joseph's life Inspiration has set before us. In words of divine power and beauty, Jacob, in the blessing pronounced upon his children, spoke thus of his best-loved son: \n     \"Joseph is a fruitful bough, \n      Even a fruitful bough by a well; \n      Whose branches run over the wall: \n      The archers have sorely grieved him, \n      And shot at him, and hated him: \n      But his bow abode in strength, \n      And the arms of his hands were made strong \n      By the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; . . . \n      Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; \n      And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee \n      With blessings of heaven above, \n      Blessings of the deep that lieth under: . . . \n      The blessings of thy father have prevailed \n      Above the blessings of my progenitors \n      Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: \n      They shall be on the head of Joseph, \n      And on the crown of the head of him that was separate \n          from his brethren.\" Genesis 49:22-26. \n                                                                           54", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 53}
