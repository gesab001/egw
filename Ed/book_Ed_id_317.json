{"word": "In this work we are to co-operate. \"If a man be overtaken in a fault, . . . restore such an one.\" Galatians 6:1. The word here translated \"restore\" means to put in joint, as a dislocated bone. How suggestive the figure! He who falls into error or sin is thrown out of relation to everything about him. He may realize his error, and be filled with remorse; but he cannot recover himself. He is in confusion and perplexity, worsted and helpless. He is to be reclaimed, healed, re-established. \"Ye which are \n                                                                           114\nspiritual, restore such an one.\" Only the love that flows from the heart of Christ can heal. Only he in whom that love flows, even as the sap in the tree or the blood in the body, can restore the wounded soul.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 113}
