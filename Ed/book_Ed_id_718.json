{"word": "So long as the great purpose of education is kept in view, the youth should be encouraged to advance just as far as their capabilities will permit. But before taking up the higher branches of study, let them master the lower. This is too often neglected. Even among students in the higher schools and the colleges there is great deficiency in knowledge of the common branches of education. Many students devote their time to higher mathematics when they are incapable of keeping simple accounts.

Many who have finished the study of rhetoric fail in the composition and spelling of an ordinary letter.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 234}
