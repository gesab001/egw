{"word": "Thy people \"speak one to another, everyone to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord. And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as My people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness. And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for \n                                                                           260\nthey hear thy words, but they do them not.\" Ezekiel 33:30-32.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 259}
