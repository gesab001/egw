The word of God was his instructor. \"Through Thy precepts,\" he said, \"I get understanding. . . . I have inclined mine heart to perform Thy statutes.\" Psalm 119:104-112. It was this that caused the Lord to pronounce David, when in his youth He called him to the throne, \"a man after Mine own heart.\" Acts 13:22.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 48}
