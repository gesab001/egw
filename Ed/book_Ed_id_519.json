While \"the secret things belong unto the Lord our God,\" \"those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children.\" Deuteronomy 29:29. The idea that certain portions of the Bible cannot be understood has led to neglect of some of its most important truths. The fact needs to be emphasized, and often repeated, that the mysteries of the Bible are not such because God has sought to conceal truth, but because our own weakness or ignorance makes us incapable of comprehending or appropriating truth. The limitation is not in His purpose, but in our capacity. Of those very portions of Scripture often passed by as impossible to be understood, God desires us to understand as much as our minds are capable of receiving. \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,\" that we may be \"throughly furnished unto all good works,\" 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 170}
