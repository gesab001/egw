{"word": "As it came from the Creator's hand, not only the Garden of Eden but the whole earth was exceedingly beautiful. No taint of sin, or shadow of death, marred the fair creation. God's glory \"covered the heavens, and the earth was full of His praise.\" \"The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\" Habakkuk 3:3; Job 38:7. Thus was the earth a fit emblem of Him who is \"abundant in goodness and truth\" (Exodus 34:6); a fit study for those who were made in His image. The Garden of Eden was a representation of what God desired the whole earth to become, and it was His purpose that, as the human family increased in numbers, they should establish other homes and schools like the one He had given. Thus in course of time the whole earth might be occupied with homes and schools where the words and the works of God should be studied, and where the students should thus be fitted more and more fully to reflect, throughout endless ages, the light of the knowledge of His glory.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 22}
