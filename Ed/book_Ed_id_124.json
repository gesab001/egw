{"word": "While Daniel clung to God with unwavering trust, the spirit of prophetic power came upon him. While honored by men with the responsibilities of the court and the secrets of the kingdom, he was honored by God as His ambassador, and taught to read the mysteries of ages to come. Heathen monarchs, through association with Heaven's representative, were constrained to acknowledge the God of Daniel. \"Of a truth it is,\" declared Nebuchadnezzar, \"that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets.\" And Darius, in his proclamation \"unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth,\" exalted the \"God of Daniel\" as \"the living God, and steadfast forever, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed;\" who \"delivereth and rescueth, and . . . worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth.\" Daniel 2:47; 6:25-27.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 56}
