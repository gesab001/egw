{"word": "In the early life of Solomon also are seen the results of God's method of education. Solomon in his youth made David's choice his own. Above every earthly good he asked of God a wise and understanding heart. And the Lord gave him not only that which he sought, but that also for which he had not sought--both riches and honor. The power of his understanding, the extent of his knowledge, the glory of his reign, became the wonder of the world.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 48}
