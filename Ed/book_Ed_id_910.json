{"word": "The object of discipline is the training of the child for self-government. He should be taught self-reliance and self-control. Therefore as soon as he is capable of understanding, his reason should be enlisted on the side of obedience. Let all dealing with him be such as to show obedience to be just and reasonable.

When God says \"Thou shalt not,\" He in love warns us of the consequences of disobedience, in order to save us from harm and loss.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 287}
