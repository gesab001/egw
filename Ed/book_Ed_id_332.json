{"word": "How beautiful the psalmist's description of God's care for the creatures of the woods-- \n          \"The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; \n           And the rocks for the conies.\" Psalm 104:18. \nHe sends the springs to run among the hills, where the birds have their habitation, and \"sing among the branches.\" Psalm 104:12. All the creatures of the woods and hills are a part of His great household. He opens His hand, and satisfies \"the desire of every living thing.\" Psalm 145:16.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 118}
