{"word": "The greatest of human teachers, Paul accepted the lowliest as well as the highest duties. He recognized the necessity of labor for the hand as well as for the mind, and he wrought at a handicraft for his own support. His trade of tentmaking he pursued while daily preaching the gospel in the great centers of civilization. \"These hands,\" he said, at parting with the elders of Ephesus, \"have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.\" Acts 20:34.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 66}
