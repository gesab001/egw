Our reasoning powers were given us for use, and God desires them to be exercised. \"Come now, and let us reason together\" (Isaiah 1:18), He invites us. In reliance upon Him we may have wisdom to \"refuse the evil, and choose the good.\" Isaiah 7:15; James 1:5.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 231}
