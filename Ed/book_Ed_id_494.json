{"word": "It was with songs of praise that the armies of Israel went forth to the great deliverance under Jehoshaphat. To Jehoshaphat had come the tidings of threatened war. \"There cometh a great multitude against thee,\" was the message, \"the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside.\" \"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the Lord: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.\" And Jehoshaphat, standing in the temple court before his people, poured out his soul in prayer, pleading God's promise, with confession of Israel's helplessness. \"We have no might against this great company that cometh against us,\" he said: \"neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon Thee.\" 2 Chronicles 20:2, 1, 3, 4, 12.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 163}
