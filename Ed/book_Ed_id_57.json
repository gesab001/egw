And their surroundings here were favorable for the accomplishing of God's purpose.

A pillar \n                                                                           35\nof fire by night, it assured them of the divine protection; and while they were locked in slumber, the bread of heaven fell gently upon the encampment. On every hand, vast, rugged heights, in their solemn grandeur, spoke of eternal endurance and majesty.

Here, by the manifestation of His glory, God sought to impress Israel with the holiness of His character and requirements, and the exceeding guilt of transgression.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 34}
