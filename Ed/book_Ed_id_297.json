{"word": "The wheat develops, \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" Mark 4:28. The object of the husbandman in the sowing of the seed and the culture of the plant, is the production of grain--bread for the hungry, and seed for future harvests. So the divine Husbandman looks for a harvest. He is seeking to reproduce Himself in the hearts and lives of His followers, that through them He may be reproduced in other hearts and lives.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 106}
