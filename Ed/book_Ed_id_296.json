{"word": "The plant grows by receiving that which God has provided to sustain its life. So spiritual growth is attained through co-operation with divine agencies. As the plant takes root in the soil, so we are to take root in Christ. As the plant receives the sunshine, the dew, and the rain, so are we to receive the Holy Spirit. If our hearts are stayed upon Christ, He will come unto us \"as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\" As the Sun of Righteousness, He will arise upon us \"with healing in His wings.\" We shall \"grow as the lily.\" We \"shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine.\" Hosea 6:3; Malachi 4:2; Hosea 14:5, 7.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 106}
