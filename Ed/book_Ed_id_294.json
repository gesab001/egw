{"word": "For a time the good seed may lie unnoticed in the heart, giving no evidence that it has taken root; but afterward, as the Spirit of God breathes on the soul, the hidden seed springs up, and at last brings forth fruit. In our lifework we know not which shall prosper, this or that. This question it is not for us to settle. \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\" Ecclesiastes 11:6. God's great covenant declares that \"while the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest . . . shall not cease.\" Genesis 8:22. In the confidence of this promise the husbandman tills and sows. Not less confidently are we, in the spiritual sowing, to labor, trusting His assurance: \"So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\" \"He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\" Isaiah 55:11; Psalm 126:6.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 105}
