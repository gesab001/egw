{"word": "Every parent and every teacher should cherish the attributes of Him who makes the cause of the afflicted, the suffering, and the tempted His own. He should be one who can have \"compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.\" Hebrews 5:2. Jesus treats us \n                                                                           295\nfar better than we deserve; and as He has treated us, so we are to treat others. The course of no parent or teacher is justifiable if it is unlike that which under similar circumstances the Saviour would pursue.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 294}
