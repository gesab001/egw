{"word": "\"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature\" (Mark 16:15), is Christ's command to His followers. Not that all are called to be ministers or missionaries in the ordinary sense of the term; but all may be workers with Him in giving the \"glad tidings\" to their fellow men. To all, great or small, learned or ignorant, old or young, the command is given.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 264}
