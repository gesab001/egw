{"word": "God has given in His word a picture of a prosperous man--one whose life was in the truest sense a success, a man whom both heaven and earth delighted to honor. Of his experiences Job himself says: \n\n\n     \"In the ripeness of my days, \n      When the secret of God was upon my tent; \n      When the Almighty was yet with me, \n      And my children were about me; . . . \n      When I went forth to the gate unto the city, \n      When I prepared my seat in the broad place [margin], \n      The young men saw me and hid themselves, \n      And the aged rose up and stood; \n      The princes refrained talking, \n      And laid their hand on their mouth; \n      The voice of the nobles was hushed. . . . \n\n\n     \"For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; \n      And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me; \n      Because I delivered the poor that cried, \n      The fatherless also, and him [margin], that had none to \n           help him. \n\n\n     \"The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; \n      And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. \n      I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: \n      My justice was as a robe and a diadem. \n      I was eyes to the blind, \n      And feet was I to the lame. \n      I was a father to the needy: \n      And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.\" \n     \"The stranger did not lodge in the street: \n      But I opened my doors to the traveler.\" \n\n\n     \"Unto me men gave ear, and waited. . . . \n      And the light of my countenance they cast not down. \n      I chose out their way, and sat chief, \n      And dwelt as a king in the army, \n      As one that comforteth the mourners.\" \n                       Job 29:4-16, R.V.; 31:32; 29:21-25.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 142}
