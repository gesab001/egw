{"word": "His Spirit \"maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.\" As the \"whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together\" (Romans 8:26, 22), the heart of the infinite Father is pained in sympathy. \n                                                                           264\nOur world is a vast lazar house, a scene of misery that we dare not allow even our thoughts to dwell upon. Did we realize it as it is, the burden would be too terrible. Yet God feels it all. In order to destroy sin and its results He gave His best Beloved, and He has put it in our power, through co-operation with Him, to bring this scene of misery to an end. \"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\" Matthew 24:14.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 263}
