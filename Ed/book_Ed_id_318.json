{"word": "Love's agencies have wonderful power, for they are divine. The soft answer that \"turneth away wrath,\" the love that \"suffereth long, and is kind,\" the charity that \"covereth a multitude of sins\" (Proverbs 15:1; 1 Corinthians 13:4, R.V.; 1 Peter 4:8, R.V.)--would we learn the lesson, with what power for healing would our lives be gifted! How life would be transformed, and the earth become a very likeness and foretaste of heaven!", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 114}
