{"word": "On that last sad night of the Passover supper, as He was about to go forth to betrayal and to death, His voice was lifted in the psalm: \n\n     \"Blessed be the name of the Lord \n      From this time forth and for evermore. \n      From the rising of the sun until the going down of the same \n      The Lord's name is to be praised.\" \n\n     \"I love the Lord because He hath heard my voice and my \n      supplications. \n      Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, \n      Therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live. \n\n     \"The sorrows of death compassed me, \n      And the pains of hell gat hold upon me: \n           I found trouble and sorrow. \n      Then called I upon the name of the Lord; \n           O Lord, I beseech Thee, deliver my soul. \n      Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; \n           Yea, our God is merciful. \n\n     \"The Lord preserveth the simple: \n           I was brought low, and He helped me. \n      Return unto thy rest, O my soul; \n           For the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. \n      For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes \n           from tears, and my feet from falling.\" \n                      Psalm 113:2, 3; 116:1-8.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 166}
