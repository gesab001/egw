{"word": "He who gives men power to get wealth has with the gift bound up an obligation. Of all that we acquire He claims a specified portion. The tithe is the Lord's. \"All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree,\" \"the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, . . . shall be holy unto the Lord.\" Leviticus 27:30, 32. The pledge made by Jacob at Bethel shows the extent of the obligation. \"Of all that Thou shalt give me,\" he said, \"I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.\" Genesis 28:22.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 138}
