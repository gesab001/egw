Lead them to behold the One \"altogether lovely.\" When once the gaze is fixed upon Him, the life finds its center. The enthusiasm, the generous devotion, the passionate ardor, of the youth find here their true object. Duty becomes a delight and sacrifice a pleasure. To honor Christ, to become like Him, to work for Him, is the life's highest ambition and its greatest joy.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 296}
