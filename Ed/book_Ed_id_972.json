We shall share the treasures gained through ages upon ages spent in contemplation of God's handiwork. And the years of eternity, as they roll, will continue to bring more glorious revelations. \"Exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think\" (Ephesians 3:20) will be, forever and forever, the impartation of the gifts of God.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 307}
