{"word": "This is a question that demands consideration by every parent, every teacher, every student--by every human being, young or old. No scheme of business or plan of life can be sound or complete that embraces only the brief years of this present life and makes no provision for the unending future. Let the youth be taught to take eternity into their reckoning. Let them be taught to choose the principles and seek the possessions that are enduring--to lay up for themselves that \"treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth;\" to make to themselves friends \"by means of the mammon of unrighteousness,\" that when it shall fail, these may receive them \"into the eternal tabernacles.\" Luke 12:33; 16:9, R.V.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 145}
