{"word": "\"Your eyes shall be opened,\" the enemy had said; \"ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\" Genesis 3:5. Their eyes were indeed opened; but how sad the opening! The knowledge of evil, the curse of sin, was all that the transgressors gained. There was nothing poisonous in the fruit itself, and the sin was not merely in yielding to appetite. It was distrust of God's goodness, disbelief of His word, and rejection of His authority, that made our first parents transgressors, and that brought into the world a knowledge of evil. It was this that opened the door to every species of falsehood and error.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 25}
