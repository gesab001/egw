{"word": "As time passed, and Elijah was prepared for translation, so Elisha was prepared to become his successor. And again his faith and resolution were tested. Accompanying Elijah in his round of service, knowing the change soon to come, he was at each place invited by the prophet to turn back. \"Tarry here, I pray thee,\" Elijah said; \"for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel.\" But in his early labor of guiding the plow, Elisha had learned not to fail or to become discouraged; and now that he had set his hand to the plow in another line of duty, he would not be diverted from his purpose. As often as the invitation to turn back was given, his answer was, \"As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.\" 2 Kings 2:2.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 59}
