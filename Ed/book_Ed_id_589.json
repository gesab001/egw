He should see how this controversy enters into every phase of human experience; how in every act of life he himself reveals the one or the other of the two antagonistic motives; and how, whether he will or not, he is even now deciding upon which side of the controversy he will be found. \n                                                                           191", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 190}
