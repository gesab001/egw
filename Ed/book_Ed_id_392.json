{"word": "The psalmist's words, \"The law of Thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver\" (Psalm 119:72), state that which is true from other than a religious point of view. They state an absolute truth and one that is recognized in the business world. Even in this age of passion for money getting, when competition is so sharp and methods are so unscrupulous, it is still widely acknowledged that, for a young man starting in life, integrity, diligence, temperance, purity, and thrift constitute a better capital than any amount of mere money.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 137}
