{"word": "Like the first is the second commandment--\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" Matthew 22:39. The law of love calls for the devotion of body, mind, and soul to the service of God and our fellow men. And this service, while making us a blessing to others, brings the greatest blessing to ourselves. Unselfishness underlies all true development. Through unselfish service we receive the highest culture of every faculty. More and more fully do we become partakers of the divine nature. We are fitted for heaven, for we receive heaven into our hearts.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 16}
