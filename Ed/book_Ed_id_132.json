{"word": "Elisha, Faithful in Little Things \n\n     The early years of the prophet Elisha were passed in the quietude of country life, under the teaching of God and nature and the discipline of useful work. In a time of almost universal apostasy his father's household were among the number who had not bowed the knee to Baal. Theirs was a home where God was honored and where faithfulness to duty was the rule of daily life.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 58}
