{"word": "Chap. 31 - The Lifework\n\n     Success in any line demands a definite aim. He who would achieve true success in life must keep steadily in view the aim worthy of his endeavor. Such an aim is set before the youth of today. The heaven-appointed purpose of giving the gospel to the world in this generation is the noblest that can appeal to any human being. It opens a field of effort to everyone whose heart Christ has touched.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 262}
