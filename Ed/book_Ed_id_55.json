{"word": "This was the method of education that God desired to establish in Israel. But when brought out of Egypt there were among the Israelites few prepared to be workers together with Him in the training of their children. The parents themselves needed instruction and discipline. Victims of lifelong slavery, they were ignorant, untrained, degraded. They had little knowledge of God and little faith in Him.

God desired to lift them to a higher moral level, and to this end He sought to give them a knowledge of Himself.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 34}
