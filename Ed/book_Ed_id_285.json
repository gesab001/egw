{"word": "The Law of Ministry \n\n     All things both in heaven and in earth declare that the great law of life is a law of service. The infinite Father ministers to the life of every living thing. Christ came to the earth \"as He that serveth.\" Luke 22:27. The angels are \"ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.\" Hebrews 1:14. The same law of service is written upon all things in nature. The birds of the air, the beasts of the field, the trees of the forest, the leaves, the grass, and the flowers, the sun in the heavens and the stars of light--all have their ministry. Lake and ocean, river and water spring--each takes to give.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 103}
