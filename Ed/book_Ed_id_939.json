It is through such experiences that all who have ever made life worth the living have achieved success. \n     \"The heights by great men reached and kept \n        Were not attained by sudden flight, \n     But they, while their companions slept, \n       Were toiling upward in the night.\" \n\n     \"We rise by things that are under our feet; \n       By what we have mastered of good and gain; \n     By the pride deposed and the passion slain, \n       And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet.\" \n\n     \"All common things, each day's events, \n        That with the hour begin and end, \n     Our pleasures and our discontents, \n       Are rounds by which we may ascend.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 296}
