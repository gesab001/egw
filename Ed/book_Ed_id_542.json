{"word": "Upon the banks of the river Chebar, Ezekiel beheld a whirlwind seeming to come from the north, \"a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber.\" A number of wheels, intersecting one another, were moved by four living beings. High above all these \"was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.\" \"And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand \n                                                                           178\nunder their wings.\" Ezekiel 1:4, 26; 10:8. The wheels were so complicated in arrangement that at first sight they appeared to be in confusion; but they moved in perfect harmony. Heavenly beings, sustained and guided by the hand beneath the wings of the cherubim, were impelling these wheels; above them, upon the sapphire throne, was the Eternal One; and round about the throne a rainbow, the emblem of divine mercy.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 177}
