{"word": "With such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might furnish, how soon the message of a crucified, risen, and soon-coming Saviour might be carried to the whole world! How soon might the end come--the end of suffering and sorrow and sin! How soon, in place of a possession here, with its blight of sin and pain, our children might receive their inheritance where \"the righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever;\" where \"the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick,\" and \"the voice of weeping shall be no more heard.\" Psalm 37:29; Isaiah 33:24; 65:19.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 271}
