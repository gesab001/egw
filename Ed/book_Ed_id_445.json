{"word": "By Faith to Conquest \n\n     The truth that as a man \"thinketh in his heart, so is he\" (Proverbs 23:7), finds another illustration in Israel's experience. On the borders of Canaan the spies, returned from searching the country, made their report. The beauty and fruitfulness of the land were lost sight of through fear of the difficulties in the way of its occupation. The cities walled up to heaven, the giant warriors, the iron chariots, daunted their faith. Leaving God out of the question, the multitude echoed the decision of the unbelieving spies, \"We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.\" Numbers 13:31. Their words proved true. They were not able to go up, and they wore out their lives in the desert.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 149}
