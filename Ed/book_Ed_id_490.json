{"word": "The earliest song recorded in the Bible from the lips of men was that glorious outburst of thanksgiving by the hosts of Israel at the Red Sea: \n\n     \"I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously: \n      The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea. \n      The Lord is my strength and song, \n      And He is become my salvation: \n      This is my God, and I will praise Him; \n      My father's God, and I will exalt Him.\" \n\n     \"Thy right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power, \n      Thy right hand, O Lord, dasheth in pieces the enemy. . . . \n      Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the gods? \n      Who is like Thee, glorious in holiness, \n      Fearful in praises, doing wonders?\" \n\n     \"The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. . . . \n      Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously.\" \n                        Exodus 15:1, 2, 6-11, 18-21, R.V.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 162}
