{"word": "See Paul at Athens before the council of the Areopagus, as he meets science with science, logic with logic, and philosophy with philosophy. Mark how, with the tact born of divine love, he points to Jehovah as \"the Unknown God,\" whom his hearers have ignorantly worshiped; and in words quoted from a poet of their own he pictures Him as a Father whose children they are. Hear him, in that age of caste, when the rights of man as man were wholly unrecognized, as he sets forth the great truth of human brotherhood, declaring that God \"hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth.\" Then he shows how, through all the dealings of God with man, runs like a thread of gold His purpose of grace and mercy. He \"hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him, though He be not far from every one of us.\" Acts 17:23, 26, 27.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 67}
