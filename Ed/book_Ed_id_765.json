{"word": "And God has especially enjoined tender respect toward the aged. He says, \"The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.\" Proverbs 16:31. It tells of battles fought, and victories gained; of burdens borne, and temptations resisted. It tells of weary feet nearing their rest, of places soon to be vacant. Help the children to think of this, and they will smooth the path of the aged by their courtesy and respect, and will bring grace and beauty into their young lives as they heed the command to \"rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man.\" Leviticus 19:32.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 244}
