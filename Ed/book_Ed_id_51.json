{"word": "The great principles of education are unchanged. \"They stand fast for ever and ever\" (Psalm III:8); for they are the principles of the character of God. To aid the student in comprehending these principles, and in entering into that relation with Christ which will make them a controlling power in the life, should be the teacher's first effort and his constant aim. The teacher who accepts this aim is in truth a co-worker with Christ, a laborer together with God.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 30}
