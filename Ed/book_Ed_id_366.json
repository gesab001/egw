{"word": "The greatness of God is to us incomprehensible. \"The Lord's throne is in heaven\" (Psalm 11:4); yet by His Spirit He is everywhere present. He has an intimate knowledge of, and a personal interest in, all the works of His hand. \n\n\n     \"Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, \n      Who humbleth Himself to behold the things that \n          are in heaven, and in the earth!\" \n\n\n     \"Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit? \n      Or whither shall I flee from Thy presence? \n      If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there: \n      If I make my bed in the grave (see Psalm 139:8, R.V.; \n            Job 26:6, R.V., margin), behold, Thou art there. \n     \"If I take the wings of the morning, \n      And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; \n      Even there shall Thy hand lead me, \n      And Thy right hand shall hold me.\" Psalm 113:5, 6; \n                                          139:7-10. \n                                                                           133\n\n     \"Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, \n      Thou understandest my thought afar off. \n      Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, \n      And art acquainted with all my ways. . . . \n      Thou hast beset me behind and before, \n      And laid Thine hand upon me. \n      Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; \n      It is high, I cannot attain unto it.\" Psalm 139:2-6, R.V.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 132}
