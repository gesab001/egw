{"word": "Through song, David, amidst the vicissitudes of his changeful life, held communion with heaven. How sweetly are his experiences as a shepherd lad reflected in the words: \n     \"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. \n      He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: \n      He leadeth me beside the still waters. . . . \n      Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, \n      I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; \n      Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.\" Psalm 23:1-4.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 164}
