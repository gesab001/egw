{"word": "Chap. 18 - Mysteries of the Bible\n\n     No finite mind can fully comprehend the character or the works of the Infinite One. We cannot by searching find out God. To minds the strongest and most highly cultured, as well as to the weakest and most ignorant, that holy Being must remain clothed in mystery. But though \"clouds and darkness are round about Him: righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.\" Psalm 97:2, R.V. We can so far comprehend His dealing with us as to discern boundless mercy united to infinite power. We can understand as much of His purposes as we are capable of comprehending; beyond this we may still trust the hand that is omnipotent, the heart that is full of love.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 169}
