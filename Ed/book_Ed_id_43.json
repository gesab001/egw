{"word": "Chap. 4 - Relation of Education to Redemption\n\n     By sin man was shut out from God. Except for the plan of redemption, eternal separation from God, the darkness of unending night, would have been his. Through the Saviour's sacrifice, communion with God is again made possible. We may not in person approach into His presence; in our sin we may not look upon His face; but we can behold Him and commune with Him in Jesus, the Saviour. \"The light of the knowledge of the glory of God\" is revealed \"in the face of Jesus Christ.\" God is \"in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.\" 2 Corinthians 4:6; 5:19.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 28}
