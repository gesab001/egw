{"word": "The book of Revelation, in connection with the book of Daniel, especially demands study. Let every God-fearing teacher consider how most clearly to comprehend and to present the gospel that our Saviour came in person to make known to His servant John--\"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him, to show unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass.\" Revelation 1:1. None should become discouraged in the study of the Revelation because of its apparently mystical symbols. \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\" James 1:5.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 191}
