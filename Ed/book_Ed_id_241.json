Over and over again, on the very verge of ruin, Peter's words of boasting brought him nearer and still nearer to the brink. Over and over again was given the warning, \"Thou shalt . . . deny that thou knowest Me.\" Luke 22:34. It was the grieved, loving heart of the disciple that spoke out in the avowal, \"Lord, I am ready to go with Thee, both into prison, and to death\" (Luke 22:33); and He who reads the heart gave to Peter the message, little valued then, but that in the swift-falling darkness would shed a ray of hope: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" Luke 22:31, 32.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 88}
