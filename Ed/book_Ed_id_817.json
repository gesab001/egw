{"word": "Prayer and faith are closely allied, and they need to be studied together. In the prayer of faith there is a divine science; it is a science that everyone who would make his lifework a success must understand. Christ says, \"What \n                                                                           258\nthings soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\" Mark 11:24. He makes it plain that our asking must be according to God's will; we must ask for the things that He has promised, and whatever we receive must be used in doing His will. The conditions met, the promise is unequivocal.", "paragraph": 7, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 257}
