{"word": "When consideration is given to man's opportunities for research; how brief his life; how limited his sphere of action; how restricted his vision; how frequent and how great the errors in his conclusions, especially as concerns the events thought to antedate Bible history; how often the supposed deductions of science are revised or cast aside; with what readiness the assumed period of the earth's development is from time to time increased or diminished by millions of years; and how the theories advanced by different scientists conflict with one another,--considering all this, shall we, for the privilege of tracing our descent from germs and mollusks and apes, consent to cast away that statement of Holy Writ, so grand in its simplicity, \"God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him\"? Genesis 1:27. Shall we reject that genealogical record,--prouder than any treasured in the courts of kings,--\"which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God\"? Luke 3:38.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 130}
