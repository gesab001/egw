{"word": "As a shield from temptation and an inspiration to purity and truth, no other influence can equal the sense of God's presence. \"All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.\" He is \"of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.\" Hebrews 4:13; Habakkuk 1:13. This thought was Joseph's shield amidst the corruptions of Egypt. To the allurements of temptation his answer was steadfast: \"How . . . can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?\" Genesis 39:9. Such a shield, faith, if cherished, will bring to every soul.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 255}
