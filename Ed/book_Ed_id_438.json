{"word": "Jacob in his distress was not overwhelmed. He had repented, he had endeavored to atone for the wrong to his brother. And when threatened with death through the wrath of Esau, he sought help from God. \"Yea, he had power over the Angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication.\" \"And He blessed him there.\" Hosea 12:4; Genesis 32:29. In the power of His might the forgiven one stood up, no longer the supplanter, but a prince with God. He had gained not merely deliverance from his outraged brother, but deliverance from himself. The power of evil in his own nature was broken; his character was transformed.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "Ed", "page": 147}
