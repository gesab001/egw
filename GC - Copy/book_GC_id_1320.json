{"word": "Before the entrance of evil there was peace and joy throughout the universe. All was in perfect harmony with the Creator's will. Love for God was supreme, love for one another impartial. Christ the Word, the Only Begotten of God, was one with the eternal Father,--one in nature, in character, and in purpose,--the only being in all the universe that could enter into all the counsels and purposes of God. By Christ the Father wrought in the creation of all heavenly beings. \"By Him were all things created, that are in heaven, . . . whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers\" (Colossians 1:16); and to Christ, equally with the Father, all heaven gave allegiance.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 493}
