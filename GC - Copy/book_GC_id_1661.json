{"word": "The \"time of trouble, such as never was,\" is soon to open upon us; and we shall need an experience which we do not now possess and which many are too indolent to obtain.

In that time of trial, every soul must stand for himself before God. \"Though Noah, Daniel, and Job\" were in the land, \"as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.\" Ezekiel 14:20.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 622}
