{"word": "It was apostasy that led the early church to seek the aid of the civil government, and this prepared the way for the development of the papacy--the beast. Said Paul: \"There\" shall \"come a falling away, . . . and that man of sin be \n                                                                           444\nrevealed.\" 2 Thessalonians 2:3. So apostasy in the church will prepare the way for the image to the beast.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 443}
