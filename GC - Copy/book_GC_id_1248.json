{"word": "The law of God, from its very nature, is unchangeable. It is a revelation of the will and the character of its Author. God is love, and His law is love. Its two great principles are love to God and love to man. \"Love is the fulfilling of the law.\" Romans 13:10. The character of God is righteousness and truth; such is the nature of His law. Says the psalmist: \"Thy law is the truth:\" \"all Thy commandments are righteousness.\" Psalm 119:142, 172. And the apostle Paul declares: \"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.\" Romans 7:12. Such a law, being an expression of the mind and will of God, must be as enduring as its Author.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 467}
