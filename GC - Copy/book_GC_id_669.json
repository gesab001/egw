{"word": "Latimer maintained from the pulpit that the Bible ought to be read in the language of the people. The Author of Holy Scripture, said he, \"is God Himself;\" and this Scripture partakes of the might and eternity of its Author. \"There is no king, emperor, magistrate, and ruler . . . but are bound to obey . . .
