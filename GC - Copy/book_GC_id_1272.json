{"word": "The world is given up to self-indulgence. \"The lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life\" control the masses of the people. But Christ's followers have a holier calling. \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean.\" In the light of God's word we are justified in declaring that sanctification cannot be genuine which does not work this utter renunciation of the sinful pursuits and gratifications of the world.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 475}
