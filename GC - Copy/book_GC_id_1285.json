{"word": "In the typical service only those who had come before God with confession and repentance, and whose sins, through the blood of the sin offering, were transferred to the sanctuary, had a part in the service of the Day of Atonement. So in the great day of final atonement and investigative judgment the only cases considered are those of the professed people of God. The judgment of the wicked is a distinct and separate work, and takes place at a later period. \"Judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel?\" 1 Peter 4:17.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 480}
