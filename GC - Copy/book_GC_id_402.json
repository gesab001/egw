Never had any man appeared in the presence of a more imposing assembly than that before which Martin Luther was to answer for his faith. \"This appearance was of itself a signal victory over the papacy.

The pope had condemned him to perpetual silence, and he was now about to speak before thousands of attentive hearers drawn together from the farthest parts of Christendom.
