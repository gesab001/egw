{"word": "In the year 1840 another remarkable fulfillment of prophecy excited widespread interest. Two years before, Josiah Litch, one of the leading ministers preaching the second advent, published an exposition of Revelation 9, predicting the fall of the Ottoman Empire. According to his calculations, this power was to be overthrown \"in A.D. 1840, sometime in the month of August;\" and only a few days previous to its accomplishment he wrote: \"Allowing the first period, 150 years, to have been exactly fulfilled before Deacozes ascended the throne by permission of the Turks, and that the 391 years, fifteen days, commenced at the close of the first period, it will end on the 11th of August, 1840, when the Ottoman power \n                                                                           335\nin Constantinople may be expected to be broken. And this, I believe, will be found to be the case.\"--Josiah Litch, in Signs of the Times, and Expositor of Prophecy, Aug. 1, 1840.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 334}
