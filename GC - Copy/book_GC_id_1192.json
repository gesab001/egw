{"word": "The special characteristic of the beast, and therefore of his image, is the breaking of God's commandments. Says Daniel, of the little horn, the papacy: \"He shall think to change times and the law.\" Daniel 7:25, R.V. And Paul styled the same power the \"man of sin,\" who was to exalt himself above God. One prophecy is a complement of the other. Only by changing God's law could the papacy exalt itself above God; whoever should understandingly keep the law as thus changed would be giving supreme honor to that power by which the change was made. Such an act of obedience to papal laws would be a mark of allegiance to the pope in the place of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 446}
