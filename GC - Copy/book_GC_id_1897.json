{"word": "THE CORRECT REFERENCE FOR THE FIRST CITATION IS POPE GREGORY XVI'S ENCYCLICAL LETTER OF AUGUST 15, 1832.  THE RELEVANT PARAGRAPH IS HERE QUOTED IN FULL:\n     LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE\n     \"THIS SHAMEFUL FONT OF INDIFFERENTISM GIVES RISE TO THAT ABSURD AND ERRONEOUS PROPOSITION WHICH CLAIMS THAT LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE MUST BE MAINTAINED FOR EVERYONE.  IT SPREADS RUIN IN SACRED AND CIVIL AFFAIRS, THOUGH SOME REPEAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH THE GREATEST IMPUDENCE THAT SOME ADVANTAGE ACCRUES TO RELIGION FROM IT. \\91BUT THE DEATH OF THE SOUL IS WORSE THAN FREEDOM OF ERROR,' AS AUGUSTINE WAS WONT TO SAY.  WHEN ALL RESTRAINTS ARE REMOVED BY WHICH MEN ARE KEPT ON THE NARROW PATH OF TRUTH, THEIR NATURE, WHICH IS ALREADY INCLINED TO EVIL, PROPELS THEM TO RUIN.  THEN TRULY \\91THE BOTTOMLESS PIT' IS OPENED FROM WHICH JOHN SAW SMOKE ASCENDING WHICH OBSCURED THE SUN, AND OUT OF WHICH LOCUSTS FLEW FORTH TO DEVASTATE THE EARTH.  THENCE COMES TRANSFORMATION OF MINDS, CORRUPTION OF YOUTHS, CONTEMPT OF SACRED THINGS AND HOLY LAWS--IN OTHER WORDS, A PESTILENCE MORE DEADLY TO THE STATE THAN ANY OTHER.  EXPERIENCE SHOWS, EVEN FROM EARLIEST TIMES, THAT CITIES RENOWNED FOR WEALTH, DOMINION, AND GLORY PERISHED AS A RESULT OF THIS SINGLE EVIL, NAMELY IMMODERATE FREEDOM OF OPINION, LICENSE OF FREE SPEECH, AND DESIRE FOR NOVELTY.\"--AS PRINTED IN CLAUDIA CARLEN, IHM, THE PAPAL ENCYCLICALS, 1740-1878 (ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN: THE PIERIAN PRESS, 1990), VOL. 1, P. 238.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 694}
