    "word": "\"A book of remembrance\" is written before God, in which are recorded the good deeds of \"them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name.\" Malachi 3:16. Their words of faith, their acts of love, are registered in heaven. Nehemiah refers to this when he says: \"Remember me, O my God, . . . and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God.\" Nehemiah 13:14. In the book of God's remembrance every deed of righteousness is immortalized. There every temptation resisted, every evil overcome, every word of tender pity expressed, is faithfully chronicled. And every act of sacrifice, every suffering and sorrow endured for Christ's sake, is recorded. Says the psalmist: \"Thou tellest my wanderings: put Thou my tears into Thy bottle: are they not in Thy book?\" Psalm 56:8.",
