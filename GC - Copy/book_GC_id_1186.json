{"word": "The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord there will exist a state of religious declension similar to that in the first centuries. \"In the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\" 2 Timothy 3:1-5. \"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\" 1 Timothy 4:1. Satan will work \"with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness.\" And all that \"received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,\" will be left to accept \"strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.\" 2 Thessalonians 2:9-11. When this state of ungodliness shall be reached, the same results will follow as in the first centuries.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 444}
