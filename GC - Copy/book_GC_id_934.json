    "word": "Yet while it was not given to the prophets to understand fully the things revealed to them, they earnestly sought to obtain all the light which God had been pleased to make manifest. They \"inquired and searched diligently,\" \"searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify.\" What a lesson to the people of God in the Christian age, for whose benefit these prophecies were given to His servants! \"Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister.\" Witness those holy men of God as they \"inquired and searched diligently\" concerning revelations given them for generations that were yet unborn. Contrast their holy zeal with the listless unconcern with which the favored ones of later ages treat this gift of Heaven. What a rebuke to the ease-loving, world-loving indifference which is content to declare that the prophecies cannot be understood!",
