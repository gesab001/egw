{"word": "In Germany the doctrine had been taught in the eighteenth century by Bengel, a minister in the Lutheran Church and a celebrated Biblical scholar and critic. Upon completing his education, Bengel had \"devoted himself to the study of theology, to which the grave and religious tone of his mind, deepened by his early training and discipline, naturally inclined him. Like other young men of thoughtful character, before and since, he had to struggle with doubts and difficulties of a religious nature, and he alludes, with much feeling, to the 'many arrows which pierced his poor heart, and made his youth hard to bear.'\" Becoming a member of the consistory of Wurttemberg, he advocated the cause of religious liberty. \"While maintaining the rights and privileges of the church, he was an advocate for all reasonable freedom being accorded to those who felt themselves bound, on grounds of conscience, to withdraw from her communion.\"--Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th ed., art. \"Bengel.\" The good effects of this policy are still felt in his native province.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 363}
