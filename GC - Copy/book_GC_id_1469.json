    "word": "Peter on the Day of Pentecost declared that the patriarch David \"is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day.\" \"For David is not ascended into the heavens.\" Acts 2:29, 34. The fact that David remains in the grave until the resurrection proves that the righteous do not go to heaven at death. It is only through the resurrection, and by virtue of the fact that Christ has risen, that David can at last sit at the right hand of God.",
