{"word": "\"The Scriptures,\" said Zwingli, \"come from God, not from man, and even that God who enlightens will give thee to understand that the speech comes from God. The word of God . . . cannot fail; it is bright, it teaches itself, it discloses itself, it illumines the soul with all salvation and grace, comforts it in God, humbles it, so that it loses and even forfeits itself, and embraces God.\" The truth of these words Zwingli himself had proved. Speaking of his experience at this time, he afterward wrote: \"When . . . I began to give myself wholly up to the Holy Scriptures, philosophy and theology (scholastic) would always keep suggesting quarrels to me. At last I came to this, that I thought, `Thou must let all that lie, and learn the meaning of God purely out of His own simple word.' Then I began to ask God for His light, and the Scriptures began to be much easier to me.\"--Ibid., b. 8, ch. 6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 174}
