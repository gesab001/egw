{"word": "Satan can present a counterfeit so closely resembling the truth that it deceives those who are willing to be deceived, who desire to shun the self-denial and sacrifice demanded by the truth; but it is impossible for him to hold under his power one soul who honestly desires, at whatever cost, to know the truth. Christ is the truth and the \"Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" John 1:9. The Spirit of truth has been sent to guide men into all truth. And upon the authority of the Son of God it is declared: \"Seek, and ye shall find.\" \"If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine.\" Matthew 7:7; John 7:17.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 528}
