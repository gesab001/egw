{"word": "In a letter to the elector, after stating his purpose to leave the Wartburg, Luther said: \"Be it known to your highness that I am going to Wittenberg under a protection far higher than that of princes and electors. I think not of soliciting your highness's support, and far from desiring your protection, \n                                                                           189\nI would rather protect you myself. If I knew that your highness could or would protect me, I would not go to Wittenberg at all. There is no sword that can further this cause. God alone must do everything, without the help or concurrence of man. He who has the greatest faith is he who is most able to protect.\"--Ibid., b. 9, ch. 8.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 188}
