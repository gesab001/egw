{"word": "The coming of the Lord has been in all ages the hope of His true followers. The Saviour's parting promise upon Olivet, that He would come again, lighted up the future for His disciples, filling their hearts with joy and hope that  sorrow could not quench nor trials dim. Amid suffering and persecution, the \"appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ\" was the \"blessed hope.\" When the Thessalonian Christians were filled with grief as they buried their loved ones, who had hoped to live to witness the coming of the Lord, Paul, their teacher, pointed them to the resurrection, to take place at the Saviour's advent. Then the dead in Christ should rise, and together with the living be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. \"And so,\" he said, \"shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.\" 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 302}
