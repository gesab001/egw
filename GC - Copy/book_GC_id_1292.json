{"word": "Those who in the judgment are \"accounted worthy\" will have a part in the resurrection of the just. Jesus said: \"They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, . . . are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.\" Luke 20:35, 36. And again He declares that \"they that have done good\" shall come forth \"unto the resurrection of life.\" John 5:29. The righteous dead will not be raised until after the judgment at which they are accounted worthy of \"the resurrection of life.\" Hence they will not be present in person at the tribunal when their records are examined and their cases decided.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 482}
