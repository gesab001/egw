{"word": "The prophecy which seemed most clearly to reveal the time of the second advent was that of Daniel 8:14: \"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\" Following his rule of making Scripture its own interpreter, Miller learned that a day in symbolic prophecy represents a year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6); he saw that the period of 2300 prophetic days, or literal years, would extend far beyond the close of the Jewish dispensation, hence it could not refer to the sanctuary of that dispensation. Miller accepted the generally received view that in the Christian age \n                                                                           325\nthe earth is the sanctuary, and he therefore understood that the cleansing of the sanctuary foretold in Daniel 8:14 represented the purification of the earth by fire at the second coming of Christ. If, then, the correct starting point could be found for the 2300 days, he concluded that the time of the second advent could be readily ascertained. Thus would be revealed the time of that great consummation, the time when the present state, with \"all its pride and power, pomp and vanity, wickedness and oppression, would come to an end;\" when the curse would be \"removed from off the earth, death be destroyed, reward be given to the servants of God, the prophets and saints, and them who fear His name, and those be destroyed that destroy the earth.\"--Bliss, page 76.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 324}
