    "word": "While Satan is constantly seeking to blind their minds to the fact, let Christians never forget that they \"wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in high places.\" Ephesians 6:12, margin. The inspired warning is sounding down the centuries to our time: \"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.\" 1 Peter 5:8. \"Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\" Ephesians 6:11.",
