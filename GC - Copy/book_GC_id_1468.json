{"word": "When, in answer to his prayer, Hezekiah's life was prolonged fifteen years, the grateful king rendered to God a tribute of praise for His great mercy. In this song he tells the reason why he thus rejoices: \"The grave cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise Thee, as I do this day.\" Isaiah 38:18, 19. Popular theology represents the righteous dead as in heaven, entered into bliss and praising God with an immortal tongue; but Hezekiah could see no such glorious prospect in death. With his words agrees the testimony of the psalmist: \"In death there is no remembrance of Thee: in the grave who shall give Thee thanks?\" \"The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.\" Psalm 6:5; 115:17.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 546}
