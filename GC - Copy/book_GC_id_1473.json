Thus a leading religious writer, commenting on the words of Paul in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, says: \"For all practical purposes of comfort the doctrine of the blessed immortality of the righteous takes the place for us of any doubtful doctrine of the Lord's second coming.

They do not wait for the trump for their judgment and blessedness.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 547}
