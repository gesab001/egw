{"word": "Besides the coming of the Lord to His temple, Malachi also foretells His second advent, His coming for the execution of the judgment, in these words: \"And I will come near \n                                                                           426\nto you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not Me, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Malachi 3:5. Jude refers to the same scene when he says, \"Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds.\" Jude 14, 15. This coming, and the coming of the Lord to His temple, are distinct and separate events.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 425}
