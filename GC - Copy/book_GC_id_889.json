{"word": "The seventy weeks, or 490 years, especially allotted to the Jews, ended, as we have seen, in A.D. 34. At that time, through the action of the Jewish Sanhedrin, the nation sealed its rejection of the gospel by the martyrdom of Stephen and the persecution of the followers of Christ. Then the message of salvation, no longer restricted to the chosen people, was given to the world. The disciples, forced by persecution to flee from Jerusalem, \"went everywhere preaching the word.\" \"Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.\" Peter, divinely guided, opened the gospel to the centurion of Caesarea, the God-fearing Cornelius; and the ardent Paul, won to the faith of Christ, was commissioned to carry the glad tidings \"far hence unto the Gentiles.\" Acts 8:4, 5;  22:21.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 328}
