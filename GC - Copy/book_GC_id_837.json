{"word": "The intense darkness of the day was succeeded, an hour or two before evening, by a partially clear sky, and the sun appeared, though it was still obscured by the black, heavy mist. \"After sundown, the clouds came again overhead, and \n                                                                           308\nit grew dark very fast.\" \"Nor was the darkness of the night less uncommon and terrifying than that of the day;  notwithstanding there was almost a full moon, no object was discernible but by the help of some artificial light, which, when seen from the neighboring houses and other places at a distance, appeared through a kind of Egyptian darkness which seemed almost impervious to the rays.\"--Isaiah Thomas, Massachusetts Spy; or, American Oracle of Liberty, vol. 10, No. 472 (May 25, 1780). Said an eyewitness of the scene: \"I could not help conceiving at the time, that if every luminous body in the universe had been shrouded in impenetrable shades, or struck out of existence, the darkness could not have been more complete.\"--Letter by Dr. Samuel Tenney, of Exeter, New Hampshire, December, 1785 (in Massachusetts Historical Society Collections, 1792, 1st series, vol. 1, p. 97). Though at nine o'clock that night the moon rose to the full, \"it had not the least effect to dispel the deathlike shadows.\" After midnight the darkness disappeared, and the moon, when first visible, had the appearance of blood.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 307}
