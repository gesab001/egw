{"word": "Chap. 31 - Agency of Evil Spirits\n\n     The connection of the visible with the invisible world, the ministration of angels of God, and the agency of evil spirits, are plainly revealed in the Scriptures, and inseparably interwoven with human history. There is a growing tendency to disbelief in the existence of evil spirits, while the holy angels that \"minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation\" (Hebrews 1:14) are regarded by many as spirits of the dead. But the Scriptures not only teach the existence of angels, both good and evil, but present unquestionable proof that these are not disembodied spirits of dead men.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 511}
