In both Germany and the Netherlands a class of fanatics had risen, advocating absurd and seditious doctrines, outraging order and decency, and proceeding to violence and insurrection. Menno saw the horrible results to which these movements would inevitably lead, and he strenuously opposed the erroneous teachings and wild schemes of the fanatics.

Among these classes Menno labored with great zeal and success.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 239}
