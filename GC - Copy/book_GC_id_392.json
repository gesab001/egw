{"word": "To a crowded assembly he spoke from the words of Christ, \"Peace be unto you.\" \"Philosophers, doctors, and writers,\" he said, \"have endeavored to teach men the way to obtain everlasting life, and they have not succeeded.

This is the work of salvation. . . . Christ has vanquished! this is the joyful news; and we are saved by His work, and not by our own. . . . Our Lord Jesus Christ said, 'Peace be unto you; behold My hands;' that is to say, Behold, O man! it is I, I alone, who have taken away thy sin, and ransomed thee; and now thou hast peace, saith the Lord.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 152}
