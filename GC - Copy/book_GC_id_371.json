{"word": "Chap. 8 - Luther Before the Diet\n\n     A new emperor, Charles V, had ascended the throne of Germany, and the emissaries of Rome hastened to present their congratulations and induce the monarch to employ his power against the Reformation. On the other hand, the elector of Saxony, to whom Charles was in great degree indebted for his crown, entreated him to take no step against Luther until he should have granted him a hearing. The emperor was thus placed in a position of great perplexity and embarrassment. The papists would be satisfied with nothing short of an imperial edict sentencing Luther to death. The elector had declared firmly that \"neither his imperial majesty nor any other person had shown that Luther's writings had been refuted;\" therefore he requested \"that Dr. Luther should be furnished with a safe-conduct, so that he might appear before a tribunal of learned, pious, and impartial judges.\"--D'Aubigne, b. 6, ch. 11.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 145}
