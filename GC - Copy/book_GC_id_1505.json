{"word": "Satan has long been preparing for his final effort to deceive the world. The foundation of his work was laid by the assurance given to Eve in Eden: \"Ye shall not surely die.\" \"In the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\" Genesis 3:4, 5. Little by little he has prepared the way for his masterpiece of deception in the development of spiritualism. He has not yet reached the full accomplishment of his designs; but it will be reached in the last remnant of time. Says the prophet: \"I saw three unclean spirits like frogs; . . . they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth \n                                                                           562\nunto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.\" Revelation 16:13, 14. Except those who are kept by the power of God, through faith in His word, the whole world will be swept into the ranks of this delusion. The people are fast being lulled to a fatal security, to be awakened only by the outpouring of the wrath of God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 561}
