{"word": "While the Christian's life will be characterized by humility, it should not be marked with sadness and self-depreciation. It is the privilege of everyone so to live that God will approve and bless him. It is not the will of our heavenly Father that we should be ever under condemnation and darkness. There is no evidence of true humility in going with the head bowed down and the heart filled with thoughts of self. We may go to Jesus and be cleansed, and stand before the law without shame and remorse. \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" Romans 8:1.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 477}
