{"word": "The fact that an angel is said to be the herald of this warning is significant. By the purity, the glory, and the power of the heavenly messenger, divine wisdom has been pleased to represent the exalted character of the work to be accomplished by the message and the power and glory that were to attend it. And the angel's flight \"in the midst of heaven,\" the \"loud voice\" with which the warning is uttered, and its promulgation to all \"that dwell on the earth,\"--\"to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,\"--give evidence of the rapidity and world-wide extent of the movement.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 355}
