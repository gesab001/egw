{"word": "The first angel's message of Revelation 14, announcing the hour of God's judgment and calling upon men to fear and worship Him, was designed to separate the professed people of God from the corrupting influences of the world and to arouse them to see their true condition of worldliness and backsliding. In this message, God has sent to the church a warning, which, had it been accepted, would have corrected the evils that were shutting them away from Him. Had they received the message from heaven, humbling their hearts before the Lord and seeking in sincerity a preparation to stand in His presence, the Spirit and power of God would have been manifested among them. The church would again have reached that blessed state of unity, faith, and love which existed in apostolic days, when the believers \"were of one heart and of one soul,\" and \"spake the word of God with boldness,\" when \"the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.\" Acts 4:32, 31; 2:47.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 379}
