{"word": "To those who urged that \"the preaching of the gospel answers all the ends of the law,\" Wesley replied: \"This we utterly deny. It does not answer the very first end of the law, namely, the convincing men of sin, the awakening those who are still asleep on the brink of hell.\" The apostle Paul declares that \"by the law is the knowledge of sin;\" \"and not until man is convicted of sin, will he truly feel his need of the atoning blood of Christ. . . . 'They that be whole,' as our Lord Himself observes, 'need not a physician, but they that are sick.' It is absurd, therefore, to offer a physician to them that are whole, or that at least imagine themselves so to be. You are first to convince them that they are sick; otherwise they will not thank you for your labor. It is equally absurd to offer Christ to them whose heart is whole, having never yet been broken.\"--Ibid., sermon 35.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 264}
