    "word": "Wycliffe fully expected that his life would be the price of his fidelity. The king, the pope, and the bishops were united to accomplish his ruin, and it seemed certain that a few months at most would bring him to the stake. But his courage was unshaken. \"Why do you talk of seeking the crown of martyrdom afar?\" he said. \"Preach the gospel of Christ to haughty prelates, and martyrdom will not fail you. What! I should live and be silent? . . . Never! Let the blow fall, I await its coming.\"--D'Aubigne, b. 17, ch. 8.",
