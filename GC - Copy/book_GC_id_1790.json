It is seen that all His dealings in the great controversy have been conducted \n                                                                           671\nwith respect to the eternal good of His people and the good of all the worlds that He has created. \"All Thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord; and Thy saints shall bless Thee.\" Psalm 145:10.
