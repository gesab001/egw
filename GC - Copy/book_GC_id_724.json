{"word": "The periods here mentioned--\"forty and two months,\" and \"a thousand two hundred and threescore days\"--are the same, alike representing the time in which the church of Christ was to suffer oppression from Rome. The 1260 years of papal supremacy began in A.D. 538, and would therefore terminate in 1798. (See Appendix note for page 54.) At that time a French army entered Rome and made the pope a prisoner, and he died in exile. Though a new pope was soon afterward elected, the papal hierarchy has never since been able to wield the power which it before possessed.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 266}
