{"word": "Lucifer might have remained in favor with God, beloved and honored by all the angelic host, exercising his noble powers to bless others and to glorify his Maker. But, says the prophet, \"Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.\" Verse 17. Little by little, Lucifer came to indulge a desire for self-exaltation. \"Thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God.\" \"Thou hast said, . . . I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation....I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\" Verse 6; Isaiah 14:13, 14. Instead of seeking to make God supreme in the affections and allegiance of His creatures, it was Lucifer's endeavor to win their service and homage to himself. And coveting the honor which the infinite Father had bestowed upon His Son, this prince of angels aspired to power which it was the prerogative of Christ alone to wield.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 494}
