{"word": "Of Babylon, at the time brought to view in this prophecy, it is declared: \"Her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.\" Revelation 18:5. She has filled up the measure of her guilt, and destruction is about to fall upon her. But God still has a people in Babylon; and before the visitation of His judgments these faithful ones must be called out, that they partake not of her sins and \"receive not of her plagues.\" Hence the movement symbolized by the angel coming down from heaven, lightening the earth with his glory and crying mightily with a strong voice, announcing the sins of Babylon. In connection with his message the call is heard: \"Come out of her, My people.\" These announcements, uniting with the third angel's message, constitute the final warning to be given to the inhabitants of the earth.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 604}
