    "word": "What was the origin of the great apostasy? How did the church first depart from the simplicity of the gospel? By conforming to the practices of paganism, to facilitate the acceptance of Christianity by the heathen. The apostle Paul declared, even in his day, \"The mystery of iniquity doth already work.\" 2 Thessalonians 2:7. During the lives of the apostles the church remained comparatively pure. But \"toward the latter end of the second century most of the churches assumed a new form; the first simplicity disappeared, and insensibly, as the old disciples retired to their graves, their children, along with new converts, . . . came forward and new-modeled the cause.\"--Robert Robinson, Ecclesiastical Researches, ch. 6, par. 17, p. 51. To secure converts, the exalted standard of the Christian faith was lowered, and as the result \"a pagan flood, flowing into the church, carried with it its customs, practices, and idols.\" --Gavazzi, Lectures, page 278. As the Christian religion secured the favor and support of secular rulers, it was nominally accepted by multitudes; but while in appearance Christians, many \"remained in substance pagans, especially worshiping in secret their idols.\"--Ibid., page 278.",
