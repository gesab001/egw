{"word": "Is he now free to transgress God's law? Says Paul: \"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\" \"How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?\" And John declares: \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous.\" Romans 3:31; 6:2; 1 John 5:3. In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty. The old life of alienation from God has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith and love, has begun. Then \"the righteousness of the law\" will \"be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" Romans 8:4. And the language of the soul will be: \"O how love I Thy law! it is my meditation all the day.\" Psalm 119:97.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 468}
