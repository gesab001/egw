{"word": "Twenty-five years later appeared the next sign mentioned in the prophecy--the darkening of the sun and moon. What  rendered this more striking was the fact that the time of its fulfillment had been definitely pointed out. In the Saviour's conversation with His disciples upon Olivet, after describing the long period of trial for the church,--the 1260 years of papal persecution, concerning which He had promised that the tribulation should be shortened,--He thus mentioned certain events to precede His coming, and fixed the time when the first of these should be witnessed: \"In those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light.\" Mark 13:24. The 1260 days, or years, terminated in 1798. A quarter of a century earlier, persecution had almost wholly ceased. Following this persecution, according to the words of Christ, the sun was to be  darkened. On the 19th of May, 1780, this prophecy was fulfilled.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 306}
