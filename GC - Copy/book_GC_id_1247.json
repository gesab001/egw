{"word": "The claim that Christ by His death abolished His Father's law is without foundation. Had it been possible for the law to be changed or set aside, then Christ need not have died to save man from the penalty of sin. The death of Christ, so far from abolishing the law, proves that it is immutable. The Son of God came to \"magnify the law, and make it honorable.\" Isaiah 42:21. He said: \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law;\" \"till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.\" Matthew 5:17, 18. And concerning Himself He declares: \"I delight to do Thy will, O my God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\" Psalm 40:8. \n                                                                           467", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 466}
