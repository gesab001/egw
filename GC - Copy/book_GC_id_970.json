{"word": "Wolff believed the coming of the Lord to be at hand, his interpretation of the prophetic periods placing the great consummation within a very few years of the time pointed out by Miller. To those who urged from the scripture, \"Of that day and hour knoweth no man,\" that men are to know nothing concerning the nearness of the advent, Wolff replied: \"Did our Lord say that that day and hour should never be known? Did He not give us signs of the times, in order \n                                                                           360\nthat we may know at least the approach of His coming, as one knows the approach of the summer by the fig tree putting forth its leaves? Matthew 24:32. Are we never to know that period, whilst He Himself exhorteth us not only to read Daniel the prophet, but to understand it? and in that very Daniel, where it is said that the words were shut up to the time of the end (which was the case in his time), and that 'many shall run to and fro' (a Hebrew expression for observing and thinking upon the time), 'and knowledge' (regarding that time) 'shall be increased.' Daniel 12:4. Besides this, our Lord does not intend to say by this, that the approach of the time shall not be known, but that the exact 'day and hour knoweth no man.' Enough, He does say, shall be known by the signs of the times, to induce us to prepare for His coming, as Noah prepared the ark.\"--Wolff, Researches and Missionary Labors, pages 404, 405.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 359}
