{"word": "In the presence of the monarch and the leading men of Sweden, Olaf Petri with great ability defended the doctrines of the reformed faith against the Romish champions. He declared that the teachings of the Fathers are to be received only when in accordance with the Scriptures; that the essential doctrines of the faith are presented in the Bible in a clear and simple manner, so that all men may understand them. Christ said, \"My doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me\" (John 7:16); and Paul declared that should he preach any other gospel than that which he had received, he would be accursed (Galatians 1:8). \"How, then,\" said the Reformer, \"shall others presume to enact dogmas at their pleasure, and impose them as things necessary to salvation?\"--Wylie, b. 10, ch. 4. He showed that the decrees of the church are of no authority when in opposition to the commands of God, and maintained the great Protestant principle that \"the Bible and the Bible only\" is the rule of faith and practice.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 243}
