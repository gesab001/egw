    "word": "When persecution was kindled against the teachers of the truth, they gave heed to the words of Christ: \"When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\" Matthew 10:23.

Wherever they could obtain a hearing was a consecrated temple. The truth, proclaimed with such energy and assurance, spread with irresistible power.",
