{"word": "In the midst of Eden grew the tree of life, whose fruit had the power of perpetuating life. Had Adam remained obedient to God, he would have continued to enjoy free access to this tree and would have lived forever. But when he sinned he was cut off from partaking of the tree of life, and he became subject to death. The divine sentence, \"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return,\" points to the utter extinction of life.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 532}
