    "word": "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the Creator and that to Him all other beings owe their existence. And wherever, in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the heathen, is presented, there is cited the evidence of His creative power. \"All the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.\" Psalm 96:5. \"To whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things.\" \"Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the earth and made it: . . . I am the Lord; and there is none else.\" Isaiah 40:25, 26; 45:18. Says the psalmist: \"Know ye that the Lord He is God: it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.\" \"O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.\" Psalm 100:3; 95:6. And the holy beings who worship God in heaven state, as the reason why their homage is due to Him: \"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for Thou hast created all things.\" Revelation 4:11.",
