    "word": "With blasphemous boldness almost beyond belief, one of the priests of the new order said: \"God, if You exist, avenge Your injured name. I bid You defiance! You remain silent; You dare not launch Your thunders. Who after this will believe in Your existence?\"--Lacretelle, History, vol. 11, p. 309; in Sir Archibald Alison, History of Europe, vol. 1, ch. 10. What an echo is this of the Pharaoh's demand: \"Who is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice?\" \"I know not Jehovah!\"",
