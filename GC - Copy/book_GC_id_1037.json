As the founders, those who possessed the true spirit of reform, pass away, their descendants come forward and \"new-model the cause.\" While blindly clinging to the creed of their fathers and refusing to accept any truth in advance of what they saw, the children of the reformers depart widely from their example of humility, self-denial, and renunciation of the world.
