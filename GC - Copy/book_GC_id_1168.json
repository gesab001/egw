{"word": "In Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Creator; and the prophecy brings to view a class that, as the result of the threefold message, are keeping the commandments of God. One of these commandments points directly to God as the Creator. The fourth precept declares: \"The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: . . . for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.\" Exodus 20:10, 11. Concerning the Sabbath, the Lord says, further, that it is \"a sign, . . . that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.\" Ezekiel 20:20. And the reason given is: \"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.\" Exodus 31:17.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 437}
