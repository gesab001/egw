{"word": "The doctrine preached by Zwingli was not received from Luther. It was the doctrine of Christ. \"If Luther preaches Christ,\" said the Swiss Reformer, \"he does what I am doing. Those whom he has brought to Christ are more numerous than those whom I have led. But this matters not. I will bear no other name than that of Christ, whose soldier I am, and who alone is my Chief. Never has one single word been written by me to Luther, nor by Luther to me. And why? . . . That it might be shown how much the Spirit of God is in unison with itself, since both of us, without any collusion, teach the doctrine of Christ with such uniformity.\" --D'Aubigne, b. 8, ch. 9.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 174}
