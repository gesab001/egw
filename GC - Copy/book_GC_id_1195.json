{"word": "The claim so often put forth that Christ changed the Sabbath is disproved by His own words. In His Sermon on the Mount He said: \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven,\" Matthew 5:17-19.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 447}
