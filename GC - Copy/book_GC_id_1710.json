The heavens are rolled together as a scroll, the earth trembles before Him, and every mountain and island is moved out of its place. \"Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people.\" Psalm 50:3,4.",
