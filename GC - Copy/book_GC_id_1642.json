It will be urged that the few who stand in opposition to an institution of the church and a law of the state ought not to be tolerated; that it is better for them to suffer than for whole nations to be thrown into confusion and lawlessness. The same argument many centuries ago was brought against Christ by the \"rulers of the people.\" \"It is expedient for us,\" said the wily Caiaphas, \"that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.\" John 11:50. This argument will appear conclusive; and a decree will finally be issued against those who hallow the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, denouncing them as deserving of the severest punishment and giving \n                                                                           616\nthe people liberty, after a certain time, to put them to death. Romanism in the Old World and apostate Protestantism in the New will pursue a similar course toward those who honor all the divine precepts.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 615}
