{"word": "When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship the beast and his image and receive his mark (Revelation 14:9, 10), will be poured out. The plagues upon Egypt when God was about to deliver Israel were similar in character to those \n                                                                           628\nmore terrible and extensive judgments which are to fall upon the world just before the final deliverance of God's people. Says the revelator, in describing those terrific scourges: \"There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshiped his image.\" The sea \"became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.\" And \"the rivers and fountains of waters . . . became blood.\" Terrible as these inflictions are, God's justice stands fully vindicated. The angel of God declares: \"Thou art righteous, O Lord, . . . because Thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and Thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.\" Revelation 16:2-6. By condemning the people of God to death, they have as truly incurred the guilt of their blood as if it had been shed by their hands. In like manner Christ declared the Jews of His time guilty of all the blood of holy men which had been shed since the days of Abel; for they possessed the same spirit and were seeking to do the same work with these murderers of the prophets.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 627}
