{"word": "The redeemed raise a song of praise that echoes and re-echoes through the vaults of heaven: \"Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.\" Verse 10. And angel and seraph unite their voices in adoration. As the redeemed have beheld the power and malignity of Satan, they have seen, as never before, that no power but that of Christ could have made them conquerors. In all that shining throng there are none to ascribe salvation to themselves, as if they had prevailed by their own power and goodness. Nothing is said of what they have done or suffered; but the burden of every song, the keynote of every anthem, is: Salvation to our God and unto the Lamb. \n                                                                           666", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 665}
