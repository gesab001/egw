{"word": "The unfaithfulness of the church to Christ in permitting her confidence and affection to be turned from Him, and allowing the love of worldly things to occupy the soul, is likened to the violation of the marriage vow. The sin of Israel in departing from the Lord is presented under this figure; and the wonderful love of God which they thus despised is touchingly portrayed: \"I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest Mine.\" \"And thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through My comeliness, which I had put upon thee. . . . But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown.\" \"As a wife treacherously departeth from her \n                                                                           382\nhusband, so have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord;\" \"as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!\" Ezekiel 16:8, 13-15, 32; Jeremiah 3:20.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 381}
