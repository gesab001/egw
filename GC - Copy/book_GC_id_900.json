A large number of the ministers of his denomination also approved his work, and it was with their formal sanction that he continued his labors.

For several years his expenses were met wholly from his own private purse, and he never afterward received enough to meet the expense of travel to the places where he was invited. Thus his public labors, so far from being a pecuniary benefit, were a heavy tax upon his property, which gradually diminished during this period of his life.
