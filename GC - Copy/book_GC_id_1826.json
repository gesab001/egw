{"word": "THE HISTORICAL THEORY DEVELOPED IN THE \"DONATION\" IS FULLY DISCUSSED IN HENRY E. CARDINAL MANNING'S THE TEMPORAL POWER OF THE VICAR OF JESUS CHRIST, LONDON, 1862. THE ARGUMENTS OF THE \"DONATION\" WERE OF A SCHOLASTIC TYPE, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A FORGERY WAS NOT MENTIONED UNTIL THE RISE OF HISTORICAL CRITICISM IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY. NICHOLAS OF CUSA WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO CONCLUDE THAT CONSTANTINE NEVER MADE ANY SUCH DONATION. LORENZA VALLA IN ITALY GAVE A BRILLIANT DEMONSTRATION OF ITS SPURIOUSNESS IN 1450. SEE CHRISTOPHER B. COLEMAN'S TREATISE OF LORENZO VALLA ON THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE (NEW YORK, 1927). FOR A CENTURY LONGER, HOWEVER, THE BELIEF IN THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE \"DONATION\" AND OF THE FALSE DECRETALS WAS KEPT ALIVE. FOR EXAMPLE, MARTIN LUTHER AT FIRST ACCEPTED THE DECRETALS, BUT HE SOON SAID TO ECK: \"I IMPUGN THESE DECRETALS;\" AND TO SPALATIN: \"HE [THE POPE] DOES IN HIS DECRETALS CORRUPT AND CRUCIFY CHRIST, THAT IS, THE TRUTH.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 682}
