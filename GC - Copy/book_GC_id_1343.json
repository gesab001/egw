    "word": "When the great sacrifice had been consummated, Christ ascended on high, refusing the adoration of angels until He had presented the request: \"I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.\" John 17:24. Then with inexpressible love and power came forth the answer from the Father's throne: \"Let all the angels of God worship Him.\" Hebrews 1:6. Not a stain rested upon Jesus. His humiliation ended, His sacrifice completed, there was given unto Him a name that is above every name.",
