{"word": "Here are revealed the heights of attainment that we may reach through faith in the promises of our heavenly Father, when we fulfill His requirements. Through the merits of Christ we have access to the throne of Infinite Power. \"He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\" Romans 8:32. The Father gave His Spirit without measure to His Son, and we also may partake of its fullness. Jesus says, \"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?\" Luke 11:13. \"If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it.\" \"Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.\" John 14:14: 16:24.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 477}
