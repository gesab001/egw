    "word": "The few faithful builders upon the true foundation (1 Corinthians 3:10, 11) were perplexed and hindered as the rubbish of false doctrine obstructed the work. Like the builders upon the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah's day, some were ready to say: \"The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build.\" Nehemiah 4:10. Wearied with the constant struggle against persecution, fraud, iniquity, and every other obstacle that Satan could devise to hinder their progress, some who had been faithful builders became disheartened; and for the sake of peace and security for their property and their lives, they turned away from the true foundation. Others, undaunted by the opposition of their enemies, fearlessly declared: \"Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible\" (verse 14); and they proceeded with the work, everyone with his sword girded by his side. Ephesians 6:17.",
