{"word": "The infidel Voltaire once boastingly said: \"I am weary of hearing people repeat that twelve men established the Christian religion. I will prove that one man may suffice to overthrow it.\" Generations have passed since his death. Millions have joined in the war upon the Bible. But it is so far from being destroyed, that where there were a hundred in Voltaire's time, there are now ten thousand, yes, a hundred thousand copies of the book of God. In the words of an early Reformer concerning the Christian church, \"The Bible is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.\" Saith the Lord: \"No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.\" Isaiah 54:17.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 288}
