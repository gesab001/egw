NOW, IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, CAME A FURTHER EXPANSION OF CHRISTIANITY. NOT SO MANY CONTINENTS OR MAJOR COUNTRIES WERE ENTERED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS IN THE PRECEDING THREE CENTURIES. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE, FOR ON ALL THE LARGER LAND MASSES OF THE EARTH EXCEPT AUSTRALIA AND AMONG ALL THE MORE NUMEROUS PEOPLES AND IN ALL THE AREAS OF HIGH CIVILIZATION CHRISTIANITY HAD BEEN INTRODUCED BEFORE A.D. 1800. WHAT NOW OCCURRED WAS THE ACQUISITION OF FRESH FOOTHOLDS IN REGIONS AND AMONG PEOPLES ALREADY TOUCHED, AN EXPANSION OF UNPRECEDENTED EXTENT FROM BOTH THE NEWER BASES AND THE OLDER ONES, AND THE ENTRANCE OF CHRISTIANITY INTO THE LARGE MAJORITY OF SUCH COUNTRIES, ISLANDS, PEOPLES, AND TRIBES AS HAD PREVIOUSLY NOT BEEN TOUCHED. . . .",
