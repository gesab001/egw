    "word": "In secret places the word of God was thus brought forth and read, sometimes to a single soul, sometimes to a little company who were longing for light and truth. Often the entire night was spent in this manner. So great would be the wonder and admiration of the listeners that the messenger of mercy was not infrequently compelled to cease his reading until the understanding could grasp the tidings of salvation. Often would words like these be uttered: \"Will God indeed accept my offering? Will He smile upon me? Will He pardon me?\" The answer was read: \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" Matthew 11:28.",
