{"word": "Royal edicts, general councils, and church ordinances  sustained by secular power were the steps by which the pagan festival attained its position of honor in the Christian world. The first public measure enforcing Sunday observance was the law enacted by Constantine. (A.D. 321; see Appendix note for page 53.) This edict required townspeople to rest on \"the venerable day of the sun,\" but permitted countrymen to continue their agricultural pursuits. Though virtually a heathen statute, it was enforced by the emperor after his nominal acceptance of Christianity.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 574}
