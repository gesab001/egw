{"word": "The holy places of the sanctuary in heaven are represented by the two apartments in the sanctuary on earth. As in vision the apostle John was granted a view of the temple of God in heaven, he beheld there \"seven lamps of fire burning before the throne.\" Revelation 4:5. He saw an angel \"having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.\" Revelation 8:3. Here the prophet was permitted to behold the first apartment \n                                                                           415\nof the sanctuary in heaven; and he saw there the \"seven lamps of fire\" and \"the golden altar,\" represented by the golden candlestick and the altar of incense in the sanctuary on earth. Again, \"the temple of God was opened\" (Revelation 11:19), and he looked within the inner veil, upon the holy of holies. Here he beheld \"the ark of His testament,\" represented by the sacred chest constructed by Moses to contain the law of God.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 414}
