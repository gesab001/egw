{"word": "Persecution in its varied forms is the development of a principle which will exist as long as Satan exists and  Christianity has vital power. No man can serve God without enlisting against himself the opposition of the hosts of darkness. Evil angels will assail him, alarmed that his influence is taking the prey from their hands. Evil men, rebuked by his example, will unite with them in seeking to separate him from God by alluring temptations. When these do not succeed, then a compelling power is employed to force the conscience.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 610}
