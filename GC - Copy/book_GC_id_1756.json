{"word": "That the expression \"bottomless pit\" represents the earth in a state of confusion and darkness is evident from other scriptures. Concerning the condition of the earth \"in the beginning,\" the Bible record says that it \"was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.\" [THE HEBREW WORD HERE TRANSLATED \"DEEP\" IS RENDERED IN THE SEPTUAGINT (GREEK) TRANSLATION OF THE HEBREW OLD TESTAMENT BY THE SAME WORD RENDERED \"BOTTOMLESS PIT\" IN REVELATION 20:1-3.] \n                                                                           659\nGenesis 1:2. Prophecy teaches that it will be brought back, partially at least, to this condition. Looking forward to the great day of God, the prophet Jeremiah declares: \"I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down.\" Jeremiah 4:23-26.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 658}
