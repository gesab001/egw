{"word": "Yet God had bidden His messenger: \"Make this man to understand the vision.\" That commission must be fulfilled. In obedience to it, the angel, some time afterward, returned to Daniel, saying: \"I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding;\" \"therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.\" Daniel 8:27, 16; 9:22, 23, 25-27. There was one important point in the vision of chapter 8 which had been left unexplained, namely, that relating to time--the period of the 2300 days; therefore the angel, in resuming his explanation, dwells chiefly upon the subject of time: \n                                                                           326", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 325}
