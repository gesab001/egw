    "word": "The worship of images and relics, the invocation of saints, and the exaltation of the pope are devices of Satan to attract the minds of the people from God and from His Son. To accomplish their ruin, he endeavors to turn their attention from Him through whom alone they can find salvation. He will direct them to any object that can be substituted for the One who has said: \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" Matthew 11:28.",
