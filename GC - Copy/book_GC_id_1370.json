{"word": "We are informed in Scripture as to the number, and the power and glory, of the heavenly beings, of their connection with the government of God, and also of their relation to the work of redemption. \"The Lord hath prepared His throne in the heavens; and His kingdom ruleth over all.\" And, says the prophet, \"I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne.\" In the presence chamber of the King of kings they wait--\"angels, that excel in strength,\" \"ministers of His, that do His pleasure,\" \"hearkening unto the voice of His word.\" Psalm 103:19-21; Revelation 5:11. Ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands, were the heavenly messengers beheld by the prophet Daniel. The apostle Paul declared them \"an innumerable company.\" Daniel 7:10; Hebrews 12:22. As God's messengers they go forth, like \"the appearance of a flash of lightning,\" (Ezekiel 1:14), so dazzling their glory, and so swift their flight. The angel that appeared at the Saviour's tomb, his countenance \"like lightning, and his raiment white as snow,\" caused the keepers for fear of him to quake, and they \"became as dead men.\" Matthew 28:3, 4. When Sennacherib, the haughty Assyrian, reproached and blasphemed God, and threatened Israel with destruction, \"it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand.\" There were \"cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains,\" from the army of Sennacherib. \"So he returned with shame of face to his own land.\" 2 Kings 19:35; 2 Chronicles 32:21.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 511}
