He is always active when God is at work for the salvation of souls. When the sons of God come to present themselves before the Lord, \n                                                                           396\nSatan comes also among them. In every revival he is ready to bring in those who are unsanctified in heart and unbalanced in mind. When these have accepted some points of truth, and gained a place with believers, he works through them to introduce theories that will deceive the unwary. No man is proved to be a true Christian because he is found in company with the children of God, even in the house of worship and around the table of the Lord. Satan is frequently there upon the most solemn occasions in the form of those whom he can use as his agents.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 395}
