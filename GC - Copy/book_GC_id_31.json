He \"went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil,\" binding up the brokenhearted, setting at liberty them that were bound, restoring sight to the blind, causing the lame to walk and the deaf to hear, cleansing the lepers, raising the dead, and preaching the gospel to the poor. Acts 10:38; Luke 4:18; Matthew 11:5. To all classes alike was addressed the gracious call: \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" Matthew 11:28.",
