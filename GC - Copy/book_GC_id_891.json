{"word": "Miller and his associates at first believed that the 2300 days would terminate in the spring of 1844, whereas the prophecy \n                                                                           329\npoints to the autumn of that year. (See Appendix.) The misapprehension of this point brought disappointment and perplexity to those who had fixed upon the earlier date as the time of the Lord's coming. But this did not in the least affect the strength of the argument showing that the 2300 days terminated in the year 1844, and that the great event represented by the cleansing of the sanctuary must then take place.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 328}
