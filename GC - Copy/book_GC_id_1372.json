This Satan himself recognized when he said: \"Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not Thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side?\" Job 1:9, 10. The agency by which God protects His people is presented in the words of the psalmist: \"The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.\" Psalm 34:7.
