{"word": "In self-reproach for his own denial of the truth, Jerome continued: \"Of all the sins that I have committed since my youth, none weigh so heavily on my mind, and cause me such poignant remorse, as that which I committed in this fatal place, when I approved of the iniquitous sentence rendered against Wycliffe, and against the holy martyr, John Huss, my master and my friend. Yes! I confess it from my heart, and declare with horror that I disgracefully quailed when, through a dread of death, I condemned their doctrines. I therefore supplicate . . . Almighty God to deign to pardon me my sins, and this one in particular, the most heinous of all.\" Pointing to his judges, he said firmly: \"You condemned Wycliffe and John Huss, not for having shaken the doctrine of the church, but simply because they branded with reprobation the scandals proceeding from the clergy--their pomp, their pride, and all the vices of the prelates and priests. \n                                                                           114\nThe things which they have affirmed, and which are irrefutable, I also think and declare, like them.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 113}
