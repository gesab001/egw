{"word": "It was God's will that the tidings of the Saviour's coming should be given in the Scandinavian countries; and when the voices of His servants were silenced, He put His Spirit upon the children, that the work might be accomplished. When Jesus drew near to Jerusalem attended by the rejoicing multitudes that, with shouts of triumph and the waving of palm branches, heralded Him as the Son of David, the jealous Pharisees called upon Him to silence them; but Jesus answered that all this was in fulfillment of prophecy, and if these should hold their peace, the very stones would cry out. The people, intimidated by the threats of the priests and rulers, ceased their joyful proclamation as they entered the gates of Jerusalem; but the children in the temple courts afterward took up the refrain, and, waving their branches of palm, they cried: \"Hosanna to the Son of David!\" Matthew 21:8-16. When the Pharisees, sorely displeased, said unto Him, \"Hearest Thou what these say?\" Jesus answered, \"Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise?\" As God wrought through children \n                                                                           368\nat the time of Christ's first advent, so He wrought through them in giving the message of His second advent. God's word must be fulfilled, that the proclamation of the Saviour's coming should be given to all peoples, tongues, and nations.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 367}
