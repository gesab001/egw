{"word": "PAGE 288. FOREIGN MISSIONS.--THE MISSIONARY ACTIVITY OF THE EARLY CHRISTIAN CHURCH HAS NOT BEEN DUPLICATED UNTIL MODERN TIMES. IT HAD VIRTUALLY DIED OUT BY THE YEAR 1000, AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY THE MILITARY CAMPAIGNS OF THE CRUSADES. THE REFORMATION ERA SAW LITTLE FOREIGN MISSION WORK, EXCEPT ON THE PART OF THE EARLY JESUITS. THE PIETISTIC REVIVAL PRODUCED SOME MISSIONARIES. THE WORK OF THE MORAVIAN CHURCH IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WAS REMARKABLE, AND THERE WERE SOME MISSIONARY SOCIETIES FORMED BY THE BRITISH FOR WORK IN COLONIZED NORTH AMERICA. BUT THE GREAT RESURGENCE OF FOREIGN MISSIONARY ACTIVITY BEGINS AROUND THE YEAR 1800, AT \"THE TIME OF THE END.\" DANIEL 12:4. IN 1792 WAS FORMED THE BAPTIST MISSIONARY SOCIETY, WHICH SENT CAREY TO INDIA. IN 1795 THE LONDON MISSIONARY SOCIETY WAS ORGANIZED, AND ANOTHER SOCIETY IN 1799 WHICH IN 1812 BECAME THE CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY. SHORTLY AFTERWARD THE WESLEYAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY WAS FOUNDED. IN THE UNITED STATES THE AMERICAN BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS WAS FORMED IN 1812, AND ADONIRAM JUDSON WAS SENT OUT THAT YEAR TO CALCUTTA. HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN BURMA THE NEXT YEAR. IN 1814 THE AMERICAN BAPTIST MISSIONARY UNION WAS FORMED. THE PRESBYTERIAN BOARD OF FOREIGN MISSIONS WAS FORMED IN 1837.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 690}
