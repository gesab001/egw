{"word": "Though the night of sorrow gathered dark about these followers of Jesus, yet were they not forsaken. Saith the prophet: \"When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. . . . He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold His righteousness.\" \"Yea, the darkness hideth not from Thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to Thee.\" God hath spoken: \"Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness.\" \"I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.\" Micah 7:8, 9; Psalm 139:12; 112:4; Isaiah 42:16.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 346}
