{"word": "The only one who promised Adam life in disobedience was the great deceiver. And the declaration of the serpent to Eve in Eden--\"Ye shall not surely die\"--was the first sermon ever preached upon the immortality of the soul. Yet this declaration, resting solely upon the authority of Satan, is echoed from the pulpits of Christendom and is received by the majority of mankind as readily as it was received by our first parents. The divine sentence, \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die\" (Ezekiel 18:20), is made to mean: The soul that sinneth, it shall not die, but live eternally. We cannot but wonder at the strange infatuation which renders men so credulous concerning the words of Satan and so unbelieving in regard to the words of God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 533}
