{"word": "Paul speaks of a class to whom the Lord's appearing will come unawares. \"The day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, . . . and they shall not escape.\" But he adds, to those who have given heed to the Saviour's warning: \"Ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.\" 1 Thessalonians 5:2-5. \n                                                                           372", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 371}
