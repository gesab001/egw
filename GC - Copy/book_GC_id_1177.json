{"word": "\"And he had two horns like a lamb.\" The lamblike horns indicate youth, innocence, and gentleness, fitly representing the character of the United States when presented to the prophet as \"coming up\" in 1798. Among the Christian exiles who first fled to America and sought an asylum from royal oppression and priestly intolerance were many who determined to establish a government upon the broad foundation of civil and religious liberty. Their views found place in the Declaration of Independence, which sets forth the great truth that \"all men are created equal\" and endowed with the inalienable right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" And the Constitution guarantees to the people the right of self-government, providing that representatives elected by the popular vote shall enact and administer the laws. Freedom of religious faith was also granted, every man being permitted to worship God according to the dictates of his conscience.
