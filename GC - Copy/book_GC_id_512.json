{"word": "The Romanists exulted, expecting to witness the speedy downfall of the Reformation; and they blamed Luther, even for the errors which he had been most earnestly endeavoring to correct. The fanatical party, by falsely claiming to have been treated with great injustice, succeeded in gaining the sympathies of a large class of the people, and, as is often the case with those who take the wrong side, they came to be regarded as martyrs.

This was the work of Satan, prompted by the same spirit of rebellion which was first manifested in heaven.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 192}
