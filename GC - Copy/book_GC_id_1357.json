{"word": "The same enmity is manifested toward Christ's followers as was manifested toward their Master. Whoever sees the repulsive character of sin, and in strength from above resists temptation, will assuredly arouse the wrath of Satan and his subjects. Hatred of the pure principles of truth, and reproach and persecution of its advocates, will exist as long as sin and sinners remain. The followers of Christ and the servants of Satan cannot harmonize. The offense of the cross has not ceased. \"All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.\" 2 Timothy 3:12.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 507}
