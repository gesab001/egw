{"word": "A portion of Ezekiel's prophecy also was a source of strength and comfort to believers: \"The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord God. . . . The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision. . . . I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged.\" \"They of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off. Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; There shall none of My words be prolonged any more, but the word \n                                                                           393\nwhich I have spoken shall be done.\" Ezekiel 12:21-25, 27, 28.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 392}
