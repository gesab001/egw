{"word": "The doctrine of the divine decrees, unalterably fixing the character of men, had led many to a virtual rejection of the law of God. Wesley steadfastly opposed the errors of the antinomian teachers and showed that this doctrine which led to antinomianism was contrary to the Scriptures. \"The grace \n                                                                           262\nof God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.\" \"This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave Himself a ransom for all.\" Titus 2:11; 1 Timothy 2:3-6. The Spirit of God is freely bestowed to enable every man to lay hold upon the means of salvation. Thus Christ, \"the true Light,\" \"lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" John 1:9. Men fail of salvation through their own willful refusal of the gift of life.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 261}
