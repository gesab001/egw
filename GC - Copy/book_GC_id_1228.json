{"word": "So far as his opportunities extend, everyone who has received the light of truth is under the same solemn and fearful responsibility as was the prophet of Israel, to whom the word of the Lord came, saying: \"Son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear \n                                                                           460\nthe word at My mouth, and warn them from Me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.\" Ezekiel 33:7-9.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 459}
