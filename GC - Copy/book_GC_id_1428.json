{"word": "But what did Adam, after his sin, find to be the meaning of the words, \"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die\"? Did he find them to mean, as Satan had led him to believe, that he was to be ushered into a more exalted state of existence? Then indeed there was great good to be gained by transgression, and Satan was proved to be a benefactor of the race. But Adam did not find this to be the meaning of the divine sentence. God declared that as a penalty for his sin, man should return to the ground whence he was taken: \"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\" Verse 19. The words of Satan, \"Your eyes shall be opened,\" proved to be true in this sense only: After Adam and Eve had disobeyed God, their eyes were opened to discern their folly; they did know evil, and they tasted the bitter fruit of transgression.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 532}
