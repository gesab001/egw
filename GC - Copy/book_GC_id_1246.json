{"word": "But not so did prophets and apostles regard the holy law of God. Said David: \"I will walk at liberty: for I seek Thy precepts.\" Psalm 119:45. The apostle James, who wrote after the death of Christ, refers to the Decalogue as \"the royal law\" and \"the perfect law of liberty.\" James 2:8; 1:25. And the revelator, half a century after the crucifixion, pronounces a blessing upon them \"that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\" Revelation 22:14.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 466}
