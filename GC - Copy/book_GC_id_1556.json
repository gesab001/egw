She bides her time, seeing that the Protestant churches are paying her homage in their acceptance of the false sabbath and that they are preparing to enforce it by the very means which she herself employed in bygone days. Those who reject the light of truth will yet seek the aid of this self-styled infallible power to exalt an institution that originated with her.

Who understands better than the papal leaders how to deal with those who are disobedient to the church?", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 580}
