    "word": "At this point another symbol is introduced. Says the prophet: \"I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb.\" Verse 11.

The great kingdoms that have ruled the world were presented to the prophet Daniel as beasts of prey, rising when \"the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.\" Daniel 7:2. In Revelation 17 an angel explained that waters represent \"peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.\" Revelation 17:15. Winds are a symbol of strife. The four winds of heaven striving upon the great sea represent the terrible scenes of conquest and revolution by which kingdoms have attained to power.",
