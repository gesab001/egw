{"word": "Rome became more and more exasperated by the attacks of Luther, and it was declared by some of his fanatical opponents, even by doctors in Catholic universities, that he who should kill the rebellious monk would be without sin. One day a stranger, with a pistol hidden under his cloak, approached the Reformer and inquired why he went thus alone. \"I am in God's hands,\" answered Luther. \"He is my strength and my shield. What can man do unto me?\"--Ibid., b. 6, ch. 2. Upon hearing these words, the stranger turned pale and fled away as from the presence of the angels of heaven.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 140}
