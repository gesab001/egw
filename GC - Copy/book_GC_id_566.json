{"word": "From the secret place of prayer came the power that shook the world in the Great Reformation. There, with holy calmness, the servants of the Lord set their feet upon the rock of His promises. During the struggle at Augsburg, Luther \"did not pass a day without devoting three hours at least to prayer, and they were hours selected from those the most favorable to study.\" In the privacy of his chamber he was heard to pour out his soul before God in words \"full of adoration, fear, and hope, as when one speaks to a friend.\" \"I know that Thou art our Father and our God,\" he said, \"and that Thou wilt scatter the persecutors of Thy children; for Thou art Thyself endangered with us. All this matter is Thine, and it is only by Thy constraint that we have put our hands to it. Defend us, then, O Father!\"--Ibid., b. 14, ch. 6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 210}
