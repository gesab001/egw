    "word": "Tyndale's preaching excited great interest; many accepted the truth. But the priests were on the alert, and no sooner had he left the field than they by their threats and misrepresentations endeavored to destroy his work. Too often they succeeded. \"What is to be done?\" he exclaimed. \"While I am sowing in one place, the enemy ravages the field I have just left. I cannot be everywhere.

Without the Bible it is impossible to establish the laity in the truth.\"--Ibid., b. 18, ch. 4.",
