{"word": "The reformed princes had determined upon having a statement of their views in systematic form, with the evidence from the Scriptures, to present before the Diet; and the task of its preparation was committed to Luther, Melanchthon, and their associates. This Confession was accepted by the Protestants as an exposition of their faith, and they assembled to affix their names to the important document. It was a solemn and trying time. The Reformers were solicitous that their cause should not be confounded with political questions; they felt that the Reformation should exercise no other influence than that which proceeds from the word of God. \n                                                                           207\nAs the Christian princes advanced to sign the Confession, Melanchthon interposed, saying: \"It is for the theologians and ministers to propose these things; let us reserve for other matters the authority of the mighty ones of the earth.\" \"God forbid,\" replied John of Saxony, \"that you should exclude me. I am resolved to do what is right, without troubling myself about my crown. I desire to confess the Lord. My electoral hat and my ermine are not so precious to me as the cross of Jesus Christ.\" Having thus spoken, he wrote down his name. Said another of the princes as he took the pen: \"If the honor of my Lord Jesus Christ requires it, I am ready . . . to leave my goods and life behind.\" \"I would rather renounce my subjects and my states, rather quit the country of my fathers staff in hand,\" he continued, \"than receive any other doctrine than that which is contained in this Confession.\" --Ibid., b. 14, ch. 6. Such was the faith and daring of those men of God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 206}
