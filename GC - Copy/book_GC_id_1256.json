    "word": "This work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by the power of the indwelling Spirit of God. Paul admonishes believers: \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Philippians 2:12, 13. The Christian will feel the promptings of sin, but he will maintain a constant warfare against it. Here is where Christ's help is needed.
