{"word": "Satan's agents are constantly working under his direction to establish his authority and build up his kingdom in opposition to the government of God. To this end they seek to deceive Christ's followers and allure them from their allegiance. Like their leader, they misconstrue and pervert the Scriptures to accomplish their object. As Satan endeavored to cast reproach upon God, so do his agents seek to malign God's people. The spirit which put Christ to death moves the wicked to destroy His followers. All this is foreshadowed in that first prophecy: \"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.\" And this will continue to the close of time.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 507}
