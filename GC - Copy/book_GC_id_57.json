    "word": "For seven years a man continued to go up and down the streets of Jerusalem, declaring the woes that were to come upon the city. By day and by night he chanted the wild dirge: \"A voice from the east! a voice from the west! a voice from the four winds! a voice against Jerusalem and against the temple! a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides! a voice against the whole people!\"--Ibid. This strange being was imprisoned and scourged, but no complaint escaped his lips. To insult and abuse he answered only: \"Woe, woe to Jerusalem!\" \"woe, woe to the inhabitants thereof!\" His warning cry ceased not until he was slain in the siege he had foretold.",
