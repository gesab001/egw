Says the apostle John, \"Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.\" 1 John 4:1. And Isaiah declares, \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\" Isaiah 8:20.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": "vii", "chapter": "Introduction"}
