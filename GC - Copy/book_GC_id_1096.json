    "word": "Chap. 23 - What is the Sanctuary?\n\n     The scripture which above all others had been both the foundation and the central pillar of the advent faith was the declaration: \"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\" Daniel 8:14. These had been familiar words to all believers in the Lord's soon coming. By the lips of thousands was this prophecy repeated as the watchword of their faith. All felt that upon the events therein foretold depended their brightest expectations and most cherished hopes. These prophetic days had been shown to terminate in the autumn of 1844. In common with the rest of the Christian world, Adventists then held that the earth, or some portion of it, was the sanctuary. They understood that the cleansing of the sanctuary was the purification of the earth by the fires of the last great day, and that this would take place at the second advent. Hence the conclusion that Christ would return to the earth in 1844.",
