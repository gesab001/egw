{"word": "Amid the reeling of the earth, the flash of lightning, and the roar of thunder, the voice of the Son of God calls forth the sleeping saints. He looks upon the graves of the righteous, then, raising His hands to heaven, He cries: \"Awake, awake, awake, ye that sleep in the dust, and arise!\" Throughout the length and breadth of the earth the dead shall hear that voice, and they that hear shall live. And the whole earth shall ring with the tread of the exceeding great army of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. From the prison house of death they come, clothed with immortal glory, crying: \"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\" 1 Corinthians 15:55. And the living righteous and the risen saints unite their voices in a long, glad shout of victory.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 644}
