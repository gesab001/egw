    "word": "Great dangers threatened the Reformation; but its advocates still trusted their cause with God, and pledged themselves to be firm to the gospel. The elector of Saxony was urged by his councilors not to appear at the Diet. The emperor, they said, required the attendance of the princes in order to draw them into a snare. \"Is it not risking everything to go and shut oneself up within the walls of a city with a powerful enemy?\" But others nobly declared, \"Let the princes only comport themselves with courage, and God's cause is saved.\" \"God is faithful; He will not abandon us,\" said Luther.--Ibid., b. 14, ch. 2. The elector set out, with his retinue, for Augsburg. All were acquainted with the dangers that menaced him, and many went forward with gloomy countenance and troubled heart. But Luther, who accompanied them as far as Coburg, revived their sinking faith by singing the hymn, written on that journey, \"A strong tower is our God.\" Many an anxious foreboding was banished, many a heavy heart lightened, at the sound of the inspiring strains.",
