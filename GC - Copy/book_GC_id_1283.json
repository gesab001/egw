{"word": "Thus was presented to the prophet's vision the great and solemn day when the characters and the lives of men should pass in review before the Judge of all the earth, and to every man should be rendered \"according to his works.\" The Ancient of Days is God the Father. Says the psalmist: \"Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.\" Psalm 90:2. It is He, the source of all being, and the fountain of all law, that is to preside in the judgment. And holy angels as ministers and witnesses, in number \"ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,\" attend this great tribunal.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 479}
