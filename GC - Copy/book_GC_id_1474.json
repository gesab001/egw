    "word": "But when about to leave His disciples, Jesus did not tell them that they would soon come to Him. \"I go to prepare a place for you,\" He said. \"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself.\" John 14:2, 3. And Paul tells us, further, that \"the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\" And he adds: \"Comfort one another with these words.\" 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18. How wide the contrast between these words of comfort and those of the Universalist minister previously quoted! The latter consoled the bereaved friends with the assurance that, however sinful the dead might have been, when he breathed out his life here he was to be received among the angels. Paul points his brethren to the future coming of the Lord, when the fetters of the tomb shall be broken, and the \"dead in Christ\" shall be raised to eternal life.",
