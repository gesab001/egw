{"word": "God's judgments will be visited upon those who are seeking to oppress and destroy His people. His long forbearance with the wicked emboldens men in transgression, but their punishment is nonetheless certain and terrible because it is long delayed. \"The Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim, He shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that He may do His work, His strange work; and bring to pass His act, His strange act.\" Isaiah 28:21. To our merciful God the act of punishment is a strange act. \"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked.\" Ezekiel 33:11. The Lord is \"merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, . . . forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.\" Yet He will \"by no means clear the guilty.\" \"The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked.\" Exodus 34:6, 7; Nahum 1:3. By terrible things in righteousness He will vindicate the authority of His downtrodden law. The severity of the retribution awaiting the transgressor may be judged by the Lord's reluctance to execute justice. The nation with which He bears long, and which He will not smite until it has filled up the measure of its iniquity in God's account, will finally drink the cup of wrath unmixed with mercy.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 627}
