{"word": "Chap. 34 - Can Our Dead Speak to Us?\n\n     The ministration of holy angels, as presented in the Scriptures, is a truth most comforting and precious to every follower of Christ. But the Bible teaching upon this point has been obscured and perverted by the errors of popular theology. The doctrine of natural immortality, first borrowed from the pagan philosophy, and in the darkness of the great apostasy incorporated into the Christian faith, has supplanted the truth, so plainly taught in Scripture, that \"the dead know not anything.\" Multitudes have come to believe that it is spirits of the dead who are the \"ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.\" And this notwithstanding the testimony of Scripture to the existence of heavenly angels, and their connection with the history of man, before the death of a human being.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 551}
