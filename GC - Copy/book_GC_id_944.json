Even after entering upon His earthly mission, the Saviour, wearied with the stubbornness and ingratitude of men, might have drawn back from the sacrifice of Calvary. In Gethsemane the cup of woe trembled in His hand. He might even then have wiped the blood-sweat from His brow and have left the guilty race to perish in their iniquity. Had He done this, there could have been no redemption for fallen men. But when the Saviour yielded up His life, and with His expiring breath cried out, \"It is finished,\" then the fulfillment of the plan of redemption was assured.

The kingdom of grace, which had before existed by the promise of God, was then established.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 347}
