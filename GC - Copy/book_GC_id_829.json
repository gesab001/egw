    "word": "\"The shock\" of the earthquake \"was instantly followed by the fall of every church and convent, almost all the large public buildings, and more than one fourth of the houses. In about two hours after the shock, fires broke out in different quarters, and raged with such violence for the space of nearly three days, that the city was completely desolated. The earthquake happened on a holyday, when the churches and convents were full of people, very few of whom escaped.\"-- Encyclopedia Americana, art. \"Lisbon,\" note (ed. 1831). \"The terror of the people was beyond description. Nobody wept; it was beyond tears. They ran hither and thither,  delirious with horror and astonishment, beating their faces and breasts, crying, 'Misericordia! the world's at an end!' Mothers forgot their children, and ran about loaded with crucifixed images. Unfortunately, many ran to the churches for protection; but in vain was the sacrament exposed; in vain did the poor creatures embrace the altars; images, priests, and people were buried in one common ruin.\" It has been estimated that ninety thousand persons lost their lives on that fatal day.",
