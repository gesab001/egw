{"word": "\"Power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.\" And, says the prophet, \"I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death.\" And again: \"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.\" The forty and two months are the same as the \"time and times and the dividing of time,\" three years and a half, or 1260 days, of Daniel 7 -  -  the time during which the papal power was to oppress God's people. This period, as stated in preceding chapters, began with the supremacy of the papacy, A.D. 538, and terminated in 1798. At that time the pope was made captive by the French army, the papal power received its deadly wound, and the prediction was fulfilled, \"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 439}
