    "word": "God's faithful witnesses, slain by the blasphemous power that \"ascendeth out of the bottomless pit,\" were not long to remain silent. \"After three days and a half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.\" Revelation 11:11. It was in 1793 that the decrees which abolished the Christian religion and set aside the Bible passed the French Assembly. Three years and a half later a resolution rescinding these decrees, thus granting toleration to the Scriptures, was adopted by the same body. The world stood aghast at the enormity of guilt which had resulted from a rejection of the Sacred Oracles, and men recognized the necessity of faith in God and His word as the foundation of virtue and morality. Saith the Lord: \"Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel,\" Isaiah 37:23. \"Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know My hand and My might; and they shall know that My name is Jehovah.\" Jeremiah 16:21, A.R.V.",
