It was in 1793 that the decrees which abolished the Christian religion and set aside the Bible passed the French Assembly.

Saith the Lord: \"Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel,\" Isaiah 37:23. \"Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know My hand and My might; and they shall know that My name is Jehovah.\" Jeremiah 16:21, A.R.V.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 287}
