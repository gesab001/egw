{"word": "Concerning the two witnesses the prophet declares further: \"These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.\" \"Thy word,\" said the psalmist, \"is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\" Revelation 11:4; Psalm 119:105. The two witnesses represent the Scriptures of the Old and the New Testament. Both are important testimonies to the origin and perpetuity of the law of God. Both are witnesses also to the plan of salvation. The types, sacrifices, and prophecies of the Old Testament point forward to a Saviour to come. The Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament tell of a Saviour who has come in the exact manner foretold by type and prophecy.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 267}
