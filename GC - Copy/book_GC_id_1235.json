{"word": "It could be said of them: \"Ye sorrowed to repentance.\" \"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.\" 2 Corinthians 7:9-11.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 462}
