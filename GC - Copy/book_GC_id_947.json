{"word": "After His resurrection Jesus appeared to His disciples on the way to Emmaus, and, \"beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.\" Luke 24:27. The hearts of the disciples were stirred. Faith was kindled. They were \"begotten again into a lively hope\" even before Jesus revealed Himself to them. It was His purpose to enlighten their understanding and to fasten their faith upon the \"sure word of prophecy.\" He wished the truth to take firm root in their minds, not merely because it was supported by His personal testimony, but because of the unquestionable evidence presented by the symbols and shadows of the typical law, and by the prophecies of the Old Testament. It was needful for the followers of Christ to have an intelligent faith, not only in their own behalf, but that they might carry the knowledge of Christ to the world. And as the very first step in imparting this knowledge, Jesus directed the disciples to \"Moses and all the prophets.\" Such was the testimony given by the risen Saviour to the value and importance of the Old Testament Scriptures.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 349}
