{"word": "This warning is brought to view in Revelation 14. Here is a threefold message represented as proclaimed by heavenly beings and immediately followed by the coming of the Son of man to reap \"the harvest of the earth.\" The first of these warnings announces the approaching judgment. The prophet beheld an angel flying \"in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\" Revelation 14:6, 7. \n                                                                           312", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 311}
