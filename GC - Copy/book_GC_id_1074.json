{"word": "These types were fulfilled, not only as to the event, but as to the time. On the fourteenth day of the first Jewish month, the very day and month on which for fifteen long centuries the Passover lamb had been slain, Christ, having eaten the Passover with His disciples, instituted that feast which was to commemorate His own death as \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" That same night He was taken by wicked hands to be crucified and slain. And as the antitype of the wave sheaf our Lord was raised from the dead on the third day, \"the first fruits of them that slept,\" a sample of all the resurrected just, whose \"vile body\" shall be changed, and \"fashioned like unto His glorious body.\" Verse 20; Philippians 3:21.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 399}
