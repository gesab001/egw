{"word": "Already an interest had been awakened in the truths he taught; and the people flocked in great numbers to listen to his preaching. Many who had long since ceased to attend service were among his hearers. He began his ministry by opening the Gospels and reading and explaining to his hearers the inspired narrative of the life, teachings, and death of Christ. Here, as at Einsiedeln, he presented the word of God as the only infallible authority and the death of Christ as the only complete sacrifice. \"It is to Christ,\" he said, \"that I desire to lead you--to Christ, the true source of salvation.\" --Ibid., b. 8, ch. 6. Around the preacher crowded the people of all classes, from statesmen and scholars to the artisan and the peasant. With deep interest they listened to his words. He not only proclaimed the offer of a free salvation, but fearlessly rebuked the evils and corruptions of the times. Many returned from the cathedral praising God. \"This man,\" they said, \"is a preacher of the truth. He will be our Moses, to lead us forth from this Egyptian darkness.\"--Ibid., b. 8, ch. 6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 177}
