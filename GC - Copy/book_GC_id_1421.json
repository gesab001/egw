{"word": "\"The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers. . . . And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?\" 1 Peter 3:12, 13. When Balaam, allured by the promise of rich rewards, practiced enchantments against Israel, and by sacrifices to the Lord sought to invoke a curse upon His people, the Spirit of God forbade the evil which he longed to pronounce, and Balaam was forced to exclaim: \"How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied?\" \"Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!\" When sacrifice had again been offered, the ungodly prophet declared: \"Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and He hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it. He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the shout of a King is among them.\" \"Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!\" Yet a third time altars were erected, and again Balaam essayed to secure a curse. But from the unwilling lips of the prophet, the Spirit of God declared the prosperity of His chosen, and rebuked the folly and malice of their foes: \"Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.\" Numbers 23:8, 10, 20, 21, 23;  24:9.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 529}
