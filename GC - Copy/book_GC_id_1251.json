{"word": "The law reveals to man his sins, but it provides no remedy. \n                                                                           468\nWhile it promises life to the obedient, it declares that death is the portion of the transgressor. The gospel of Christ alone can free him from the condemnation or the defilement of sin. He must exercise repentance toward God, whose law has been transgressed; and faith in Christ, his atoning sacrifice. Thus he obtains \"remission of sins that are past\" and becomes a partaker of the divine nature. He is a child of God, having received the spirit of adoption, whereby he cries: \"Abba, Father!\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 467}
