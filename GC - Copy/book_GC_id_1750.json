{"word": "The mark of deliverance has been set upon those \"that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done.\" Now the angel of death goes forth, represented in Ezekiel's vision by the men with the slaughtering weapons, to whom the command is given: \"Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.\" Says the prophet: \"They began at the ancient men which were before the house.\" Ezekiel 9:1-6. The work of destruction begins among those who have professed to be the spiritual guardians of the people. The false watchmen are the first to fall. There are none to pity or to spare. Men, women, maidens, and little children perish together.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 656}
