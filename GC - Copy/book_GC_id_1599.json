{"word": "\"There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.\" Proverbs 16:25. Ignorance is no excuse for error or sin, when there is every opportunity \n                                                                           598\nto know the will of God. A man is traveling and comes to a place where there are several roads and a guideboard indicating where each one leads. If he disregards the guideboard, and takes whichever road seems to him to be right, he may be ever so sincere, but will in all probability find himself on the wrong road.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 597}
