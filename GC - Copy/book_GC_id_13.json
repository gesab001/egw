{"word": "Jesus promised His disciples, \"The Comforter which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\" \"When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: . . . and He will show you things to come.\" John 14:26; 16:13. Scripture plainly teaches that these promises, so far from being limited to apostolic days, extend to the church of Christ in all ages. The Saviour assures His followers, \"I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" Matthew 28:20. And Paul declares that the gifts and manifestations of the Spirit were set in the church \"for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\" Ephesians 4:12, 13.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": "viii", "chapter": "Introduction"}
