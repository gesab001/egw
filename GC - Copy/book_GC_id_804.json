{"word": "The Bible was held as the foundation of faith, the source of wisdom, and the charter of liberty. Its principles were diligently taught in the home, in the school, and in the church, and its fruits were manifest in thrift, intelligence, purity, and temperance. One might be for years a dweller in  the Puritan settlement, \"and not see a drunkard, or hear an oath, or meet a beggar.\"--Bancroft, pt. 1, ch. 19, par. 25. It was demonstrated that the principles of the Bible are the surest safeguards of national greatness. The feeble and isolated colonies grew to a confederation of powerful states, and the world marked with wonder the peace and prosperity of \"a church without a pope, and a state without a king.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 296}
