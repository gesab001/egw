{"word": "Attendance at the services of the established church was required under a penalty of fine or imprisonment. \"Williams reprobated the law; the worst statute in the English code was that which did but enforce attendance upon the parish church. To compel men to unite with those of a different creed, he regarded as an open violation of their natural rights; to drag to public worship the irreligious and the unwilling, seemed only like requiring hypocrisy. . . . 'No one should be bound to worship, or,' he added, 'to maintain a worship, against his own consent.' 'What!' exclaimed his antagonists, amazed at his tenets, 'is not the laborer worthy of his hire?' 'Yes,' replied he, 'from them that hire him.'\"-- Bancroft, pt. 1, ch. 15, par. 2.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 294}
