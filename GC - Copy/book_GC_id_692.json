{"word": "The fires of divine truth, well-nigh extinguished upon the altars of Protestantism, were to be rekindled from the ancient torch handed down the ages by the Bohemian Christians. After the Reformation, Protestantism in Bohemia had been trampled out by the hordes of Rome. All who refused to renounce the truth were forced to flee.

It was from the descendants of these Christians that light came to Wesley and his associates.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 254}
