{"word": "Chap. 36 - The Impending Conflict\n\n     From the very beginning of the great controversy in heaven it has been Satan's purpose to overthrow the law of God. It was to accomplish this that he entered upon his rebellion against the Creator, and though he was cast out of heaven he has continued the same warfare upon the earth. To deceive men, and thus lead them to transgress God's law, is the object which he has steadfastly pursued. Whether this be accomplished by casting aside the law altogether, or by rejecting one of its precepts, the result will be ultimately the same. He that offends \"in one point,\" manifests contempt for the whole law; his influence and example are on the side of transgression; he becomes \"guilty of all.\" James 2:10.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 582}
