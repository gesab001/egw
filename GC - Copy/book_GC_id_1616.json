    "word": "Fearful is the issue to which the world is to be brought. The powers of earth, uniting to war against the commandments of God, will decree that \"all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond\" (Revelation 13:16), shall conform to the customs of the church by the observance of the false sabbath. All who refuse compliance will be visited with civil penalties, and it will finally be declared that they are deserving of death. On the other hand, the law of God enjoining the Creator's rest day demands obedience and threatens wrath against all who transgress its precepts.",
