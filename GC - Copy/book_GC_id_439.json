    "word": "After his departure, still desirous that his firmness should not be mistaken for rebellion, Luther wrote to the emperor. \"God, who is the searcher of hearts, is my witness,\" he said, \"that I am ready most earnestly to obey your majesty, in honor or in dishonor, in life or in death, and with no exception save the word of God, by which man lives. In all the affairs of this present life, my fidelity shall be unshaken, for here to lose or to gain is of no consequence to salvation. But when eternal interests are concerned, God wills not that man should submit unto man. For such submission in spiritual matters is a real worship, and ought to be rendered solely to the Creator.\"--Ibid., b. 7, ch. 11.",
