{"word": "At the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from the face of the whole earth--consumed with the spirit of His mouth and destroyed by the brightness of His glory. Christ takes His people to the City of God, and the earth is emptied of its inhabitants. \"Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.\" \"The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this word.\" \"Because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned.\" Isaiah 24:1, 3, 5, 6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 657}
