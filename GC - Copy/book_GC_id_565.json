{"word": "Again, at a later date, referring to the league contemplated by the reformed princes, Luther declared that the only weapon employed in this warfare should be \"the sword of the Spirit.\" He wrote to the elector of Saxony: \"We cannot on our conscience approve the proposed alliance. We would rather die ten times than see our gospel cause one drop of blood to be shed. Our part is to be like lambs of the slaughter. The cross of Christ must be borne. Let your highness be without fear. We shall do more by our prayers than all our enemies by their boastings. Only let not your hands be stained with the blood of your brethren.

You cannot defend our faith: each one should believe at his own risk and peril.\"--Ibid., b. 14, ch. 1. \n                                                                           210", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 209}
