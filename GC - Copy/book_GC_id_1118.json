{"word": "He \"shall sit and rule upon His throne; and He shall be a priest upon His throne.\" Not now \"upon the throne of His glory;\" the kingdom of glory has not yet been ushered in. Not until His work as a mediator shall be ended will God \"give unto Him the throne of His father David,\" a kingdom of which \"there shall be no end.\" Luke 1:32, 33. As a priest, Christ is now set down with the Father in His throne. Revelation 3:21. Upon the throne with the eternal, self-existent One is He who \"hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,\" who \"was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin,\" that He might be \"able to succor them that are tempted.\" \"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father.\" Isaiah 53:4; Hebrews 4:15;  2:18; 1 John 2:1. His intercession is that of a pierced and broken body, of a spotless life. The wounded hands, the pierced side, the marred feet, plead for fallen man, whose redemption was purchased at such infinite cost.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 416}
