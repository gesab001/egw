{"word": "God has given to men a declaration of His character and of His method of dealing with sin. \"The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.\" Exodus 34:6, 7. \"All the wicked will He destroy.\" \"The transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.\" Psalm 145:20; 37:38. The power and authority of the divine government will be employed to put down rebellion; yet all the manifestations of retributive justice will be perfectly consistent with the character of God as a merciful, long-suffering, benevolent being.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 541}
