{"word": "The apostle John in vision heard a loud voice in heaven exclaiming: \"Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\" Revelation 12:12. Fearful are the scenes which call forth this exclamation from the heavenly voice. The wrath of Satan increases as his time grows short, and his work of deceit and destruction will reach its culmination in the time of trouble. \n                                                                           624", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 623}
