How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture. . . . The rivers of water are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.\" \"The songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord God: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.\" Joel 1:10-12, 17-20; Amos 8:3.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 628}
