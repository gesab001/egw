{"word": "As the ransomed ones are welcomed to the City of God, there rings out upon the air an exultant cry of adoration. The two Adams are about to meet. The Son of God is standing with outstretched arms to receive the father of our race--the being whom He created, who sinned against his Maker, and for whose sin the marks of the crucifixion are borne upon the Saviour's form. As Adam discerns the prints of the cruel nails, he does not fall upon the bosom of his Lord, but in humiliation casts himself at His feet, crying: \"Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain!\" Tenderly the Saviour lifts him up and bids him look once more upon the Eden home from which he has so long been exiled.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 647}
