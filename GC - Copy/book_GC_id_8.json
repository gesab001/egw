They are the standard of character, the revealer of doctrines, and the test of experience. \"Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.\" 2 Timothy 3:16, 17, R.V.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": "vii", "chapter": "Introduction"}
