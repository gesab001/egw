{"word": "Courts of justice are corrupt. Rulers are actuated by desire for gain and love of sensual pleasure. Intemperance has beclouded the faculties of many so that Satan has almost complete control of them. Jurists are perverted, bribed, deluded. Drunkenness and revelry, passion, envy, dishonesty of every sort, are represented among those who administer the laws. \"Justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.\" Isaiah 59:14.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 586}
