{"word": "Thomas Munzer, the most active of the fanatics, was a man of considerable ability, which, rightly directed, would have enabled him to do good; but he had not learned the first principles of true religion. \"He was possessed with a desire of reforming the world, and forgot, as all enthusiasts do, that the reformation should begin with himself.\"--Ibid., b. 9, ch. 8. He was ambitious to obtain position and influence, and was unwilling to be second, even to Luther. He declared that the Reformers, in substituting the authority of Scripture for that of the pope, were only establishing a different form of popery. He himself, he claimed, had been divinely commissioned to introduce the true reform. \"He who possesses this spirit,\" said Munzer, \"possesses the true faith, although he should never see the Scriptures in his life.\"--Ibid., b. 10, ch. 10.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 191}
