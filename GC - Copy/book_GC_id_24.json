{"word": "To unfold the scenes of the great controversy between truth and error; to reveal the wiles of Satan, and the means by which he may be successfully resisted; to present a satisfactory solution of the great problem of evil, shedding such a light upon the origin and the final disposition of sin as to make fully manifest the justice and benevolence of God in all His dealings with His creatures; and to show the holy, unchanging nature of His law, is the object of this book. That through its influence souls may be delivered from the power of darkness, and become \"partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light,\" to the praise of Him who loved us, and gave Himself for us, is the earnest prayer of the writer. --- E.G.W.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": "xii", "chapter": "Introduction"}
