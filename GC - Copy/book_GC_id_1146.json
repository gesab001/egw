{"word": "The proclamation, \"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh,\" in the summer of 1844, led thousands to expect the immediate advent of the Lord. At the appointed time the Bridegroom came, not to the earth, as the people expected, but to the Ancient of Days in heaven, to the marriage, the reception of His kingdom. \"They that were ready went in with Him to the marriage: and the door was shut.\" They were not to be present in person at the marriage; for it takes place in heaven, while they are upon the earth. The followers of Christ are to \"wait for their Lord, when He will return from the wedding.\" Luke 12:36. But they are to understand His work, and to follow Him by faith as He goes in before God. It is in this sense that they are said to go in to the marriage.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 427}
