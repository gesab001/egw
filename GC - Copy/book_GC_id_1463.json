{"word": "\"The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" Romans 6:23. While life is the inheritance of the righteous, death is the portion of the wicked. Moses declared to Israel: \"I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.\" Deuteronomy 30:15. The death referred to in these scriptures is not that pronounced upon Adam, for all mankind suffer the penalty of his transgression. It is \"the second death\" that is placed in contrast with everlasting life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 544}
