{"word": "In explaining Daniel 8:14, \"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed,\" Miller, as has been stated, adopted the generally received view that the earth is the sanctuary, and he believed that the cleansing of the sanctuary represented the purification of the earth by fire at the coming of the Lord. When, therefore, he found that the close of the 2300 days was definitely foretold, he concluded that this revealed the time of the second advent. His error resulted from accepting the popular view as to what constitutes the sanctuary.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 352}
