    "word": "And Habakkuk, rapt in holy vision, beheld His appearing. \"God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of His praise. And His brightness was as the light.\" \"He stood, and measured the earth: He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hill did bow: His ways are everlasting.\" \"Thou didst ride upon Thine horses and Thy chariots of salvation.\" \"The mountains saw Thee, and they trembled: . . . the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high. The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of Thine arrows they went, and at the shining of Thy glittering spear.\" \"Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, even for salvation with Thine anointed.\" Habakkuk 3:3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13.",
