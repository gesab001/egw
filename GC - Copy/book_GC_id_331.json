He sometimes doubted whether he had indeed been led of God to set himself against the authority of the church. \"Who was I,\" he writes, \"to oppose the majesty of the pope, before whom ... the kings of the earth and the whole world trembled? ... No one can know what my heart suffered during these first two years, and into what despondency, I may say into what despair, I was sunk.\"--Ibid., b. 3, ch. 6. But he was not left to become utterly disheartened. When human support failed, he looked to God alone and learned that he could lean in perfect safety upon that all-powerful arm.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 132}
