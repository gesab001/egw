In the presence of his judges, Jerome kneeled down and prayed that the divine Spirit might control his thoughts and words, that he might speak nothing contrary to the truth or unworthy of his Master. To him that day was fulfilled the promise of God to the first disciples: \"Ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake. . . .

For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.\" Matthew 10:18-20.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 112}
