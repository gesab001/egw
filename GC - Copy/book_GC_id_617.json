{"word": "The 21st of January, 1535, was fixed upon for the awful ceremonial. The superstitious fears and bigoted hatred of the whole nation had been roused. Paris was thronged with the multitudes that from all the surrounding country crowded her streets. The day was to be ushered in by a vast and imposing procession. \"The houses along the line of march were hung with mourning drapery, and altars rose at intervals.\" Before every door was a lighted torch in honor of the \"holy sacrament.\" Before daybreak the procession formed at the palace of the king. \"First came the banners and crosses of the several parishes; next appeared the citizens, walking two and two, and bearing torches.\" The four orders of friars followed, each in its own peculiar dress. Then came a vast collection of famous relics. Following these rode lordly ecclesiastics in their purple and scarlet robes and jeweled adornings, a gorgeous and glittering array.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 228}
