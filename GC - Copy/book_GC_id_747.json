{"word": "\"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.\" Psalm 14:1. And the Lord declares concerning the perverters of the truth: \"Their folly shall be manifest unto all.\" 2 Timothy 3:9. After France had renounced the worship of the living God, \"the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,\" it was only a little time till she descended to degrading idolatry, by the worship of the Goddess of Reason, in the person of a profligate woman. And this in the representative assembly of the nation, and by its highest civil and legislative authorities! Says the historian: \"One of the ceremonies of this insane time stands unrivaled for absurdity combined with impiety. The doors of the Convention were thrown open to a band of musicians, preceded by whom, the members of the municipal body entered in solemn procession, singing a hymn in praise of liberty, and escorting, as the object of their future worship, a veiled female, whom they termed the Goddess of Reason. Being brought within the bar, she was unveiled with great form, and placed on the right of the president, when she was generally recognized as a dancing girl of the opera. . . . To this person, as the fittest representative of that reason whom they worshiped, the National Convention of France rendered public homage.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 275}
