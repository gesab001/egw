{"word": "Just before us is \"the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.\" Revelation 3:10. All whose faith is not firmly established upon the word of God will be deceived and overcome. Satan \"works with all deceivableness of unrighteousness\" to gain control of the children of men, and his deceptions will continually increase. But he can gain his object only as men voluntarily yield to his temptations. Those who are earnestly seeking a knowledge of the truth and are striving to purify their souls through obedience, thus doing what they can to prepare for the conflict, will find, in the God of truth, a sure defense. \"Because thou hast kept the word of My patience, I also will keep thee\" (verse 10), is the Saviour's promise. He would sooner send every angel out of heaven to protect His people than leave one soul that trusts in Him to be overcome by Satan.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 560}
