{"word": "In the City of God \"there shall be no night.\" None will need or desire repose. There will be no weariness in doing the will of God and offering praise to His name. We shall ever feel the freshness of the morning and shall ever be far from its close. \"And they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.\" Revelation 22:5. The light of the sun will be superseded by a radiance which is not painfully dazzling, yet which immeasurably surpasses the brightness of our noontide. The glory of God and the Lamb floods the Holy City with unfading light. The redeemed walk in the sunless glory of perpetual day.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 676}
