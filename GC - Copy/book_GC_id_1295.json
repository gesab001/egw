{"word": "All who have truly repented of sin, and by faith claimed the blood of Christ as their atoning sacrifice, have had pardon entered against their names in the books of heaven; as they have become partakers of the righteousness of Christ, and their characters are found to be in harmony with the law of God, their sins will be blotted out, and they themselves will be accounted worthy of eternal life. The Lord declares, by the prophet Isaiah: \"I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.\" Isaiah 43:25. Said Jesus: \"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.\" \"Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven.\" Revelation 3:5; Matthew 10:32, 33.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 483}
