    "word": "Such was the work that went on, day by day, throughout the year. The sins of Israel were thus transferred to the sanctuary, and a special work became necessary for their removal. God commanded that an atonement be made for each of the sacred apartments. \"He shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.\" An atonement was also to be made for the altar, to \"cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.\" Leviticus 16:16, 19.",
