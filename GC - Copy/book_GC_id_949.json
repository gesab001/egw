{"word": "Saith the Lord: \"My people shall never be ashamed.\" Joel 2:26. \"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" Psalm 30:5. When on His resurrection day these disciples met the Saviour, and their hearts burned within them as they listened to His words; when they looked upon the head and hands and feet that had been bruised for them; when, before His ascension, Jesus led them out as \n                                                                           351\nfar as Bethany, and lifting up His hands in blessing, bade them, \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel,\" adding, \"Lo, I am with you alway\" (Mark 16:15; Matthew 28:20); when on the Day of Pentecost the promised Comforter descended and the power from on high was given and the souls of the believers thrilled with the conscious presence of their ascended Lord--then, even though, like His, their pathway led through sacrifice and martyrdom, would they have exchanged the ministry of the gospel of His grace, with the \"crown of righteousness\" to be received at His coming, for the glory of an earthly throne, which had been the hope of their earlier discipleship? He who is \"able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,\" had granted them, with the fellowship of His sufferings, the communion of His joy--the joy of \"bringing many sons unto glory,\" joy unspeakable, an \"eternal weight of glory,\" to which, says Paul, \"our light affliction, which is but for a moment,\" is \"not worthy to be compared.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 350}
