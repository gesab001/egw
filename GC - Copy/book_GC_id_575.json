{"word": "There were some among Lefevre's students who listened eagerly to his words, and who, long after the teacher's voice should be silenced, were to continue to declare the truth. Such was William Farel. The son of pious parents, and educated to accept with implicit faith the teachings of the church, he might, with the apostle Paul, have declared concerning himself: \"After the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.\" Acts 26:5. A devoted Romanist, he burned with zeal to destroy all who should dare to oppose the church. \"I would gnash my teeth like a furious wolf,\" he afterward said, referring to this period of his life, \"when I heard anyone speaking against the pope.\"--Wylie, b. 13, ch. 2. He had been untiring in his adoration of the saints, in company with Lefevre making the round of the churches of Paris, worshipping at the altars, and adorning with gifts the holy shrines. But these observances could not bring peace of soul. Conviction of sin fastened upon him, which all the acts of penance that he practiced failed to banish. As to a voice from heaven he listened to the Reformer's words: \"Salvation is of grace.\" \"The Innocent One is condemned, and the criminal is acquitted.\" \"It is the cross of Christ alone that \n                                                                           214\nopeneth the gates of heaven, and shutteth the gates of hell.\" --Ibid., b. 13, ch. 2.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 213}
