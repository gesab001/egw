{"word": "The cross of Calvary, while it declares the law immutable, proclaims to the universe that the wages of sin is death. In the Saviour's expiring cry, \"It is finished,\" the death knell of Satan was rung. The great controversy which had been so long in progress was then decided, and the final eradication of evil was made certain. The Son of God passed through the portals of the tomb, that \"through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.\" Hebrews 2:14. Lucifer's desire for self-exaltation had led him to say: \"I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: . . . I will be like the Most High.\" God declares: \"I will bring \n                                                                           504\nthee to ashes upon the earth, . . . and never shalt thou be any more.\" Isaiah 14:13, 14; Ezekiel 28:18, 19. When \"the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven;. . . .all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\" Malachi 4:1.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 503}
