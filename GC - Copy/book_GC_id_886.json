{"word": "\"From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks\"--namely, sixty-nine weeks, or 483 years. The decree of Artaxerxes went into effect in the autumn of 457 B.C. From this date, 483 years extend to the autumn of A.D. 27. (See Appendix.) At that time this prophecy was fulfilled. The word \"Messiah\" signifies \"the Anointed One.\" In the autumn of A.D. 27 Christ was baptized by John and received the anointing of the Spirit. The apostle Peter testifies that \"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power.\" Acts 10:38. And the Saviour Himself declared: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor.\" Luke 4:18. After His baptism He went into Galilee, \"preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled.\" Mark 1:14, 15.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 327}
