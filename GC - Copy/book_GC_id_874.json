    "word": "At His coming the righteous dead will be raised, and the righteous living will be changed. \"We shall not all sleep,\" says Paul, \"but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\" 1 Corinthians 15:51-53. And in his letter to the Thessalonians, after describing the coming of the Lord, he says: \"The dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\" 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17.",
