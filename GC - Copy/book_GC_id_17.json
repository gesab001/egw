{"word": "The great controversy between good and evil will increase in intensity to the very close of time. In all ages the wrath of Satan has been manifested against the church of Christ; and God has bestowed His grace and Spirit upon His people to strengthen them to stand against the power of the evil one. When the apostles of Christ were to bear His gospel to the world and to record it for all future ages, they were especially endowed with the enlightenment of the Spirit. But as the church approaches her final deliverance, Satan is to work with greater power. He comes down \"having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\" Revelation 12:12. He will work \"with all power and signs and lying wonders.\" 2 Thessalonians 2:9. For six thousand years that mastermind that once was highest among the angels of God has been wholly bent to the work of deception and ruin. And all the depths of satanic skill and subtlety acquired, all the cruelty developed, during these struggles of the ages, will be brought to bear against God's people in the final conflict. And in this time of peril the followers of Christ are to bear to the world the warning of the Lord's second advent; and a people are to be prepared to stand before Him at His coming, \"without spot, and blameless.\" 2 Peter 3:14. At this time the special endowment of divine grace and power is not less needful to the church than in apostolic days.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "GC", "page": "ix", "chapter": "Introduction"}
