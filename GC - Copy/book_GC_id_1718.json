{"word": "In the lives of all who reject truth there are moments when conscience awakens, when memory presents the torturing recollection of a life of hypocrisy and the soul is harassed with vain regrets. But what are these compared with the remorse of that day when \"fear cometh as desolation,\" when \"destruction cometh as a whirlwind\"! Proverbs 1:27. Those who would have destroyed Christ and His faithful people now witness the glory which rests upon them. In the midst of their terror they hear the voices of the saints in joyful strains exclaiming: \"Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us.\" Isaiah 25:9.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 644}
