Shall he conclude that the truth ought not to be presented, since often its only effect is to arouse men to evade or resist its claims?

The confession of faith made by saints and martyrs was recorded for the benefit of succeeding generations. Those living examples of holiness and steadfast integrity have come down to inspire courage in those who are now called to stand as witnesses for God.

Then they should let it shine forth to the world.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 459}
