An immense procession followed, hundreds of men at arms, priests and bishops in their costly robes, and the inhabitants of Constance.

I call God to witness that all that I have written and preached has been with the view of rescuing souls from sin and perdition; and, therefore, most joyfully will I confirm with my blood that truth which I have written and preached.\"--Ibid., b. 3, ch. 7.
