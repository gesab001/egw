{"word": "Before the entrance of sin, Adam enjoyed open communion with his Maker; but since man separated himself from God by transgression, the human race has been cut off from this high privilege. By the plan of redemption, however, a way has been opened whereby the inhabitants of the earth may still have connection with heaven. God has communicated with men by His Spirit, and divine light has been imparted to the world by revelations to His chosen servants. \"Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\" 2 Peter 1:21.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": "v", "chapter": "Introduction"}
