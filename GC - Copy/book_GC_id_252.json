    "word": "In another letter, to a priest who had become a disciple of the gospel, Huss spoke with deep humility of his own errors, accusing himself \"of having felt pleasure in wearing apparel and of having wasted hours in frivolous occupations.\" He then added these touching admonitions: \"May the glory of God and the salvation of souls occupy thy mind, and not the possession of benefices and estates. Beware of adorning thy house more than thy soul; and, above all, give thy care to the spiritual edifice. Be pious and humble with the poor, and consume not thy substance in feasting. Shouldst thou not amend thy life and refrain from superfluities, I fear that thou wilt be severely chastened, as I am myself. . . . Thou knowest my doctrine, for thou hast received my instructions from thy childhood; it is therefore useless for me to write to thee any further. But I conjure thee, by the mercy of our Lord, not to imitate me in any of the vanities into which thou hast seen me fall.\" On the cover of the letter he added: \"I conjure thee, my friend, not to break this seal until thou shalt have acquired the certitude that I am dead.\"--Ibid., vol. 1, pp. 148, 149.",
