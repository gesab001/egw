{"word": "In Revelation 14 the first angel is followed by a second proclaiming: \"Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.\" Revelation 14:8. The term \"Babylon\" is derived from \"Babel,\" and signifies confusion. It is employed in Scripture to designate the various forms of false or apostate religion. In Revelation 17 Babylon is represented as a woman --a figure which is used in the Bible as the symbol of a church, a virtuous woman representing a pure church, a vile woman an apostate church.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 381}
