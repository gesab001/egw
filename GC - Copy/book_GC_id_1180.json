{"word": "Such action would be directly contrary to the principles of this government, to the genius of its free institutions, to the direct and solemn avowals of the Declaration of Independence, and to the Constitution. The founders of the nation wisely sought to guard against the employment of secular power on the part of the church, with its inevitable result--intolerance and persecution. The Constitution provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" and that \"no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\" Only in flagrant violation of these safeguards to the nation's liberty, can any religious observance be enforced by civil authority. But the inconsistency of such action is no greater than is represented in the symbol. It is the beast with lamblike horns--in profession pure, gentle, and harmless--that speaks as a dragon.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 442}
