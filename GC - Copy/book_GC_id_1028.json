{"word": "The woman (Babylon) of Revelation 17 is described as \"arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness:...and upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots.\" Says the prophet: \"I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.\" Babylon is further declared to be \"that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.\" Revelation 17:4-6, 18. The power that for so many centuries maintained despotic sway over the monarchs of Christendom is Rome. The purple and scarlet color, the gold and precious stones and pearls, vividly picture the magnificence and more than kingly pomp affected by the haughty see of Rome. And no other power could be so truly declared \"drunken with the blood of the saints\" as that church which has so cruelly persecuted the followers of Christ. Babylon is also charged with the sin of unlawful connection with \"the kings of the earth.\" It was by departure from the Lord, and alliance with the heathen, that the Jewish church became a harlot; and Rome, corrupting herself in like manner by seeking the support of worldly powers, receives a like condemnation.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 382}
