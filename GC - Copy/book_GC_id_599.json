{"word": "In the Bible he found Christ. \"O Father,\" he cried, \"His sacrifice has appeased Thy wrath; His blood has washed away my impurities; His cross has borne my curse; His death has atoned for me. We had devised for ourselves many useless follies, but Thou hast placed Thy word before me like a torch, and Thou hast touched my heart, in order that I may hold in abomination all other merits save those of Jesus.\" --Martyn, vol. 3, ch. 13.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 221}
