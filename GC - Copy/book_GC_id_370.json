{"word": "Said Jesus to His disciples: \"If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept My saying, they will keep yours also.\" John 15:19, 20. And on the other hand our Lord declared plainly: \"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\" Luke 6:26. The spirit of the world is no more in harmony with the spirit of Christ today than in earlier times, and those who preach the word of God in its purity will be received with no greater favor now than then. The forms of opposition to the truth may change, the enmity may be less open because it is more subtle; but the same antagonism still exists and will be manifested to the end of time.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 144}
