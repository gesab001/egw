The fall of man and the plan of redemption were the subjects upon which he dwelt. \"In Adam,\" he said, \"we are all dead, sunk in corruption and condemnation.\" --Wylie, b. 8, ch. 9. \"Christ . . . has purchased for us a never-ending redemption. . . . His passion is . . . an eternal sacrifice, and everlastingly effectual to heal; it satisfies the divine justice forever in behalf of all those who rely upon it with firm and unshaken faith.\" Yet he clearly taught that men are not, because of the grace of Christ, free to continue in sin. \"Wherever there is faith in God, there God is; and wherever God abideth, there a zeal exists urging and impelling men to good works.\"--D'Aubigne, b. 8, ch. 9.",
