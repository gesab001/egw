{"word": "The great obstacle both to the acceptance and to the promulgation of truth is the fact that it involves inconvenience and reproach. This is the only argument against the truth which its advocates have never been able to refute. But this does not deter the true followers of Christ. These do not wait for truth to become popular. Being convinced of their duty, they deliberately accept the cross, with the apostle Paul counting that \"our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;\" with one of old, \"esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt.\" 2 Corinthians 4:17; Hebrews 11:26.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 460}
