{"word": "Solemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of the atonement. Momentous are the interests involved therein. The judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. For many years this work has been in progress. Soon--none know how soon--it will pass to the cases of the living. In the awful presence of God our lives are to come up in review. At this time above all others it behooves every soul to heed the Saviour's admonition: \"Watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.\" Mark 13:33. \"If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.\" Revelation 3:3.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 490}
