{"word": "The Bible was designed to be a guide to all who wish to become acquainted with the will of their Maker. God gave to men the sure word of prophecy; angels and even Christ Himself came to make known to Daniel and John the things that must shortly come to pass. Those important matters that concern our salvation were not left involved in mystery. They were not revealed in such a way as to perplex and mislead the honest seeker after truth. Said the Lord by the prophet Habakkuk: \"Write the vision, and make it plain, . . . that he may run that readeth it.\" Habakkuk 2:2. The word of God is plain to all who study it with a prayerful heart. Every truly honest soul will come to the light of truth. \"Light is sown for the righteous.\" Psalm 97:11. And no church can advance in holiness unless its members are earnestly seeking for truth as for hid treasure.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 521}
