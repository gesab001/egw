{"word": "Had the Reformer yielded a single point, Satan and his hosts would have gained the victory. But his unwavering firmness was the means of emancipating the church, and beginning a new and better era. The influence of this one man, who dared to think and act for himself in religious matters, was to affect the church and the world, not only in his own time, but in all future generations.

The power and majesty of God stood forth above the counsel of men, above the mighty power of Satan.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 166}
