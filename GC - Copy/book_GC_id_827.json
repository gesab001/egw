    "word": "It was in Spain and Portugal that the shock manifested its extreme violence. At Cadiz the inflowing wave was said to be sixty feet high. Mountains, \"some of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously shaken, as it were, from their very foundations, and some of them opened at their summits, which were split and rent in a wonderful manner, huge  masses of them being thrown down into the adjacent valleys. Flames are related to have issued from these mountains.\"-- Sir Charles Lyell, Principles of Geology, page 495.",
