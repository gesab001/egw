    "word": "Before the creation of man, angels were in existence; for when the foundations of the earth were laid, \"the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\" Job 38:7. After the fall of man, angels were sent to guard the tree of life, and this before a human being had died. Angels are in nature superior to men, for the psalmist says that man was made \"a little lower than the angels.\" Psalm 8:5.",
