{"word": "The grand principle maintained by these Reformers--the same that had been held by the Waldenses, by Wycliffe, by John Huss, by Luther, Zwingli, and those who united with them--was the infallible authority of the Holy Scriptures as a rule of faith and practice. They denied the right of popes, councils, Fathers, and kings, to control the conscience in matters of religion. The Bible was their authority, and by its teaching they tested all doctrines and all claims. Faith in God and His word sustained these holy men as they yielded up their lives at the stake. \"Be of good comfort,\" exclaimed Latimer to his fellow martyr as the flames were about to silence their voices, \"we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.\" --Works of Hugh Latimer, vol. 1, p. xiii.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 249}
