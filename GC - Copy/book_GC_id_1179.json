{"word": "The lamblike horns and dragon voice of the symbol point to a striking contradiction between the professions and the practice of the nation thus represented. The \"speaking\" of the nation is the action of its legislative and judicial authorities. By such action it will give the lie to those liberal and peaceful principles which it has put forth as the foundation of its policy. The prediction that it will speak \"as a dragon\" and exercise \"all the power of the first beast\" plainly foretells a development of the spirit of intolerance and persecution that was manifested by the nations represented by the dragon and the leopardlike beast. And the statement that the beast with two horns \"causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast\" indicates that the authority of this nation is to be exercised in enforcing some observance which shall be an act of homage to the papacy.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "GC", "page": 442}
