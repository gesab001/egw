    "word": "During these last months of His ministry, many of Christ's parables were spoken. The priests and rabbis pursued Him with ever-increasing bitterness, and His warnings to them He veiled in symbols. They could not mistake His meaning, yet they could find in His words nothing on which to ground an accusation against Him. In the parable of the Pharisee and the publican, the self-sufficient prayer, \"God, I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men,\" stood out in sharp contrast to the penitent's plea, \"Be merciful to me the sinner.\" Luke 18:11, 13, R. V., margin. Thus Christ rebuked the hypocrisy of the Jews. And under the figures of the barren fig tree and the great supper He foretold the doom about to fall upon the impenitent nation. Those who had scornfully rejected the invitation to the gospel feast heard His warning words: \"I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of My supper.\" Luke 14:24.",
