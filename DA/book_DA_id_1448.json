    "word": "The Pharisees had one hope left, and that was to intimidate the man's parents. With apparent sincerity they asked, \"How then doth he now see?\" The parents feared to compromise themselves; for it had been declared that whoever should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ should be \"put out of the synagogue;\" that is, should be excluded from the synagogue for thirty days. During this time no child could be circumcised nor dead be lamented in the offender's home. The sentence was regarded as a great calamity; and if it failed to produce repentance, a far heavier penalty followed. The great work wrought for their son had brought conviction to the parents, yet they answered, \"We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: but by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.\" Thus they shifted all responsibility from themselves to their son; for they dared not confess Christ.",
