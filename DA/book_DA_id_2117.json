    "word": "Christ was now standing in a different attitude from that in which He had ever stood before. His suffering can best be described in the words of the prophet, \"Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, and against the man that is My fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Zechariah 13:7. As the substitute and surety for sinful man, Christ was suffering under divine justice. He saw what justice meant. Hitherto He had been as an intercessor for others; now He longed to have an intercessor for Himself.",
