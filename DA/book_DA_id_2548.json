    "word": "But the command, \"Go ye into all the world,\" is not to be lost sight of. We are called upon to lift our eyes to the \"regions beyond.\" Christ tears away the wall of partition, the dividing prejudice of nationality, and teaches a love for all the human family. He lifts men from the narrow circle which their selfishness prescribes; He abolishes all territorial lines and artificial distinctions of society. He makes no difference between neighbors and strangers, friends and enemies. He teaches us to look upon every needy soul as our brother, and the world as our field.",
