    "word": "Amazed at his dullness of comprehension, Christ asked with pained surprise, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip?\" Is it possible that you do not see the Father in the works He does through Me? Do you not believe that I came to testify of the Father? \"How sayest thou then, Show us the Father?\" \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.\" Christ had not ceased to be God when He became man. Though He had humbled Himself to humanity, the Godhead was still His own. Christ alone could represent the Father to humanity, and this representation the disciples had been privileged to behold for over three years.",
