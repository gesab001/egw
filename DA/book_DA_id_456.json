    "word": "Jesus continued: \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\" By nature the heart is evil, and \"who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.\" Job 14:4. No human invention can find a remedy for the sinning soul. \"The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.\" \"Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.\" Romans 8:7; Matthew 15:19. The fountain of the heart must be purified before the streams can become pure. He who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law is attempting an impossibility. There is no safety for one who has merely a legal religion, a form of godliness. The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of the old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a new life altogether. This change can be brought about only by the effectual working of the Holy Spirit.",
