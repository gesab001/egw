    "word": "Still seeking to give a true direction to her faith, Jesus declared, \"I am the resurrection, and the life.\" In Christ is life, original, unborrowed, underived. \"He that hath the Son hath life.\" 1 John 5:12. The divinity of Christ is the believer's assurance of eternal life. \"He that believeth in Me,\" said Jesus, \"though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?\" Christ here looks forward to the time of His second coming. Then the righteous dead shall be raised incorruptible, and the living righteous shall be translated to heaven without seeing death. The miracle which Christ was about to perform, in raising Lazarus from the dead, would represent the resurrection of all the righteous dead. By His word and His works He declared Himself the Author of the resurrection. He who Himself was soon to die upon the cross stood with the keys of death, a conqueror of the grave, and asserted His right and power to give eternal life.",
