God with us.\" \"The light of the knowledge of the glory of God\" is seen \"in the face of Jesus Christ.\" From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one with the Father; He was \"the image of God,\" the image of His greatness and majesty, \"the outshining of His glory.\" It was to manifest this glory that He came to our world. To this sin-darkened earth He came to reveal the light of God's love,--to be \"God with us.\" Therefore it was prophesied of Him, \"His name shall be called Immanuel.\"",
