    "word": "Pilate was troubled. He had not thought it would come to that. He shrank from delivering an innocent man to the most ignominious and cruel death that could be inflicted. After the roar of voices had ceased, he turned to the people, saying, \"Why, what evil hath He done?\" But the case had gone too far for argument. It was not evidence of Christ's innocence that they wanted, but His condemnation.",
