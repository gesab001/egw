    "word": "\"I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance,\" said John; \"but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\" Matthew 3:11, R. V., margin. The prophet Isaiah had declared that the Lord would cleanse His people from their iniquities \"by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.\" The word of the Lord to Israel was, \"I will turn My hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin.\" Isaiah 4:4; 1:25. To sin, wherever found, \"our God is a consuming fire.\" Hebrews 12:29. In all who submit to His power the Spirit of God will consume sin. But if men cling to sin, they become identified with it. Then the glory of God, which destroys sin, must destroy them. Jacob, after his night of wrestling with the Angel, exclaimed, \"I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\" Genesis 32:30. Jacob had been guilty of a great sin in his conduct toward Esau; but he had repented. His transgression had been forgiven, and his sin purged; therefore he could endure the revelation of God's presence. But wherever men came before God while willfully cherishing evil, they were destroyed. At the second advent of Christ the wicked shall be consumed \"with the Spirit of His mouth,\" and destroyed \"with the brightness of His coming.\" 2 Thessalonians 2:8. The light of the glory of God, which imparts life to the righteous, will slay the wicked.",
