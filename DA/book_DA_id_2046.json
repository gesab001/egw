    "word": "Chap. 73 - \"Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled\"\n\n     Looking upon His disciples with divine love and with the tenderest sympathy, Christ said, \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.\" Judas had left the upper chamber, and Christ was alone with the eleven. He was about to speak of His approaching separation from them; but before doing this He pointed to the great object of His mission. It was this that He kept ever before Him. It was His joy that all His humiliation and suffering would glorify the Father's name. To this He first directs the thoughts of His disciples.",
