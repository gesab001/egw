    "word": "In the spirit of meekness, \"considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted,\" (Galatians 6:1), go to the erring one, and \"tell him his fault between thee and him alone.\" Do not put him to shame by exposing his fault to others, nor bring dishonor upon Christ by making public the sin or error of one who bears His name. Often the truth must be plainly spoken to the erring; he must be led to see his error, that he may reform. But you are not to judge or to condemn. Make no attempt at self-justification. Let all your effort be for his recovery. In treating the wounds of the soul, there is need of the most delicate touch, the finest sensibility. Only the love that flows from the Suffering One of Calvary can avail here. With pitying tenderness, let brother deal with brother, knowing that if you succeed, you will \"save a soul from death,\" and \"hide a multitude of sins.\" James 5:20.",
