    "word": "When the apostle Paul began his ministry in Corinth, that populous, wealthy, and wicked city, polluted by the nameless vices of heathenism, he said, \"I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\" 1 Corinthians 2:2. Writing afterward to some of those who had been corrupted by the foulest sins, he could say, \"But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\" \"I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ.\" 1 Corinthians 6:11; 1:4.",
