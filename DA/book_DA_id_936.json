{
    "word": "\"Judge not, that ye be not judged.\" Do not think yourself better than other men, and set yourself up as their judge. Since you cannot discern motive, you are incapable of judging another. In criticizing him, you are passing sentence upon yourself; for you show that you are a participant with Satan, the accuser of the brethren. The Lord says, \"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.\" This is our work. \"If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.\" 2 Corinthians 13:5; 1 Corinthians 11:31.",
