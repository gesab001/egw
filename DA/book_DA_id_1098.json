    "word": "The disciples finally came to Him, urging that for their own sake the people should be sent away. Many had come from far, and had eaten nothing since morning. In the surrounding towns and villages they might be able to buy food. But Jesus said, \"Give ye them to eat,\" and then, turning to Philip, questioned, \"Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?\" This He said to test the faith of the disciple. Philip looked over the sea of heads, and thought how impossible it would be to provide food to satisfy the wants of such a crowd. He answered that two hundred pennyworth of bread would not be nearly enough to divide among them, so that each might have a little. Jesus inquired how much food could be found among the company. \"There is a lad here,\" said Andrew, \"which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many?\" Jesus directed that these be brought to Him. Then He bade the disciples seat the people on the grass in parties of fifty or a hundred, to preserve order, and that all might witness what He was about to do. When this was accomplished, Jesus took the food, \"and looking up to heaven, He blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to His disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.\" \"And they did all eat, and were filled. And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.\"",
