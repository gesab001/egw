    "word": "God's ideal for His children is higher than the highest human thought can reach. \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" This command is a promise.

He came to destroy the works of the devil, and He has made provision that the Holy Spirit shall be imparted to every repentant soul, to keep him from sinning.",
