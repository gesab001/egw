    "word": "This figure the prophet Isaiah had applied to the Messiah's mission, in the comforting words, \"O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! . . . He shall feed His flock like a shepherd: He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom.\" Isaiah 40:9-11. David had sung, \"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\" Psalm 23:1. And the Holy Spirit through Ezekiel had declared: \"I will set up one Shepherd over them, and He shall feed them.\" \"I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick.\" \"And I will make with them a covenant of peace.\" \"And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen; . . . but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.\" Ezekiel 34:23, 16, 25, 28.",
