    "word": "Christ's example forbids exclusiveness at the Lord's Supper. It is true that open sin excludes the guilty. This the Holy Spirit plainly teaches. 1 Corinthians 5:11. But beyond this none are to pass judgment. God has not left it with men to say who shall present themselves on these occasions. For who can read the heart? Who can distinguish the tares from the wheat? \"Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.\" For \"whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.\" \"He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.\" 1 Corinthians 11:28, 27, 29.",
