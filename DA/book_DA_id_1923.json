    "word": "Then came divine submission to His Father's will. \"For this cause,\" He said, \"came I unto this hour. Father, glorify Thy name.\" Only through the death of Christ could Satan's kingdom be overthrown. Only thus could man be redeemed, and God be glorified. Jesus consented to the agony, He accepted the sacrifice. The Majesty of heaven consented to suffer as the Sin Bearer. \"Father, glorify Thy name,\" He said. As Christ spoke these words, a response came from the cloud which hovered above His head: \"I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.\" Christ's whole life, from the manger to the time when these words were spoken, had glorified God; and in the coming trial His divine-human sufferings would indeed glorify His Father's name.",
