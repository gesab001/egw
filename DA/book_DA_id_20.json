    "word": "By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more than recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separation between God and man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with us. \"God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.\" John 3:16. He gave Him not only to bear our sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-begotten Son to become one of the human family, forever to retain His human nature. This is the pledge that God will fulfill His word. \"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder.\" God has adopted human nature in the person of His Son, and has carried the same into the highest heaven. It is the \"Son of man\" who shares the throne of the universe. It is the \"Son of man\" whose name shall be called, \"Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\" Isaiah 9:6. The I AM is the Daysman between God and humanity, laying His hand upon both. He who is \"holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners,\" is not ashamed to call us brethren. Hebrews 7:26;  2:11. In Christ the family of earth and the family of heaven are bound together. Christ glorified is our brother. Heaven is enshrined in humanity, and humanity is enfolded in the bosom of Infinite Love.",
