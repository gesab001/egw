    "word": "Christ read the priest's purpose as an open book. As if reading the inmost soul of His questioner, He denied that there was between Him and His followers any secret bond of union, or that He gathered them secretly and in the darkness to conceal His designs. He had no secrets in regard to His purposes or doctrines. \"I spake openly to the world,\" He answered; \"I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.\"",
