    "word": "The Saviour longs to manifest His grace and stamp His character on the whole world. It is His purchased possession, and He desires to make men free, and pure, and holy. Though Satan works to hinder this purpose, yet through the blood shed for the world there are triumphs to be achieved that will bring glory to God and the Lamb. Christ will not be satisfied till the victory is complete, and \"He shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied.\" Isaiah 53:11. All the nations of the earth shall hear the gospel of His grace. Not all will receive His grace; but \"a seed shall serve Him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.\" Psalm 22:30. \"The kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High,\" and \"the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\" \"So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun.\" Daniel 7:27; Isaiah 11:9; 59:19.",
