    "word": "The Sun of Righteousness did not burst upon the world in splendor, to dazzle the senses with His glory. It is written of Christ, \"His going forth is prepared as the morning.\" Hosea 6:3. Quietly and gently the daylight breaks upon the earth, dispelling the shadow of darkness, and waking the world to life. So did the Sun of Righteousness arise, \"with healing in His wings.\" Malachi 4:2.",
