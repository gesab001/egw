    "word": "Whenever the message of truth comes home to souls with special power, Satan stirs up his agents to start a dispute over some minor question. Thus he seeks to attract attention from the real issue. Whenever a good work is begun, there are cavilers ready to enter into dispute over forms or technicalities, to draw minds away from the living realities. When it appears that God is about to work in a special manner for His people, let them not be enticed into a controversy that will work only ruin of souls. The questions that most concern us are, Do I believe with saving faith on the Son of God? Is my life in harmony with the divine law? \"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life.\" \"And hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.\" John 3:36; 1 John 2:3.",
