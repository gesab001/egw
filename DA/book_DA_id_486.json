    "word": "So with the followers of Christ. We can receive of heaven's light only as we are willing to be emptied of self. We cannot discern the character of God, or accept Christ by faith, unless we consent to the bringing into captivity of every thought to the obedience of Christ. To all who do this the Holy Spirit is given without measure. In Christ \"dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and in Him ye are made full.\" Colossians 2:9, 10, R. V.",
