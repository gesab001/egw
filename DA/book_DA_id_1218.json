    "word": "Caste is hateful to God. He ignores everything of this character. In His sight the souls of all men are of equal value. He \"hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him, though He be not far from every one of us.\" Without distinction of age, or rank, or nationality, or religious privilege, all are invited to come unto Him and live. \"Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference.\" \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free.\" \"The rich and poor meet together: the Lord is the Maker of them all.\" \"The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Acts 17:26, 27; Galatians 3:28; Proverbs 22:2; Romans 10:11-13.",
