    "word": "The witness borne of him after his death, by those who had heard his testimony to Jesus, was, \"John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this Man were true.\" John 10:41. It was not given to John to call down fire from heaven, or to raise the dead, as Elijah did, nor to wield Moses' rod of power in the name of God. He was sent to herald the Saviour's advent, and to call upon the people to prepare for His coming. So faithfully did he fulfill his mission, that as the people recalled what he had taught them of Jesus, they could say, \"All things that John spake of this Man were true.\" Such witness to Christ every disciple of the Master is called upon to bear.",
