    "word": "\"The head of every man is Christ.\" God, who put all things under the Saviour's feet, \"gave Him to be the head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him that filleth all in all.\" 1 Corinthians 11:3; Ephesians 1:22, 23. The church is built upon Christ as its foundation; it is to obey Christ as its head. It is not to depend upon man, or be controlled by man. Many claim that a position of trust in the church gives them authority to dictate what other men shall believe and what they shall do. This claim God does not sanction. The Saviour declares, \"All ye are brethren.\" All are exposed to temptation, and are liable to error. Upon no finite being can we depend for guidance. The Rock of faith is the living presence of Christ in the church. Upon this the weakest may depend, and those who think themselves the strongest will prove to be the weakest, unless they make Christ their efficiency. \"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.\" The Lord \"is the Rock, His work is perfect.\" \"Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.\" Jeremiah 17:5; Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 2:12.",
