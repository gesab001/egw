Sin and sinners will perish, root and branch, (Malachi 4:1),--Satan the root, and his followers the branches. The word will be fulfilled to the prince of evil, \"Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; . . . I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. . . . Thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.\" Then \"the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be;\" \"they shall be as though they had not been.\" Ezekiel 28:6-19; Psalm 37:10; Obadiah 16.",
