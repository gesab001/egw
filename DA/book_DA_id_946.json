    "word": "It is thus that every sinner may come to Christ. \"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us.\" Titus 3:5. When Satan tells you that you are a sinner, and cannot hope to receive blessing from God, tell him that Christ came into the world to save sinners. We have nothing to recommend us to God; but the plea that we may urge now and ever is our utterly helpless condition that makes His redeeming power a necessity. Renouncing all self-dependence, we may look to the cross of Calvary and say,-- \n\n\n              \"In my hand no price I bring; \n               Simply to Thy cross I cling.\"",
