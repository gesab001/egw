    "word": "Satan cannot hold the dead in his grasp when the Son of God bids them live. He cannot hold in spiritual death one soul who in faith receives Christ's word of power. God is saying to all who are dead in sin, \"Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead.\" Ephesians 5:14. That word is eternal life. As the word of God which bade the first man live, still gives us life; as Christ's word, \"Young man, I say unto thee, Arise,\" gave life to the youth of Nain, so that word, \"Arise from the dead,\" is life to the soul that receives it. God \"hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.\" Colossians 1:13. It is all offered us in His word. If we receive the word, we have the deliverance.",
