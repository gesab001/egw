    "word": "The only condition upon which the freedom of man is possible is that of becoming one with Christ. \"The truth shall make you free;\" and Christ is the truth. Sin can triumph only by enfeebling the mind, and destroying the liberty of the soul. Subjection to God is restoration to one's self,--to the true glory and dignity of man. The divine law, to which we are brought into subjection, is \"the law of liberty.\" James 2:12.",
