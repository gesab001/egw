    "word": "At the first feast He attended with His disciples, Jesus gave them the cup that symbolized His work for their salvation. At the last supper He gave it again, in the institution of that sacred rite by which His death was to be shown forth \"till He come.\" 1 Corinthians 11:26. And the sorrow of the disciples at parting from their Lord was comforted with the promise of reunion, as He said, \"I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom.\" Matthew 26:29.",
