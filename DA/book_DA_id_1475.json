    "word": "\"He calleth His own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. . . . And the sheep follow Him: for they know His voice.\" The Eastern shepherd does not drive his sheep. He depends not upon force or fear; but going before, he calls them. They know his voice, and obey the call. So does the Saviour-Shepherd with His sheep. The Scripture says, \"Thou leddest Thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.\" Through the prophet, Jesus declares, \"I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.\" He compels none to follow Him. \"I drew them,\" He says, \"with cords of a man, with bands of love.\" Psalm 77:20; Jeremiah 31:3; Hosea 11:4.",
