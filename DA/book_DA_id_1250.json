    "word": "Jesus continued: \"I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" The word Peter signifies a stone,--a rolling stone. Peter was not the rock upon which the church was founded. The gates of hell did prevail against him when he denied his Lord with cursing and swearing. The church was built upon One against whom the gates of hell could not prevail.",
