    "word": "It was a bright picture which the words of Christ had called up, but across it lay a heavy shadow, which His eye alone discerned. \"The days will come,\" He said, \"when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.\" When they should see their Lord betrayed and crucified, the disciples would mourn and fast. In His last words to them in the upper chamber, He said, \"A little while, and ye shall not see Me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see Me. Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.\" John 16:19, 20.",
