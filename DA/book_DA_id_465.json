    "word": "There was no excuse for the blindness of Israel in regard to the work of regeneration. Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Isaiah had written, \"We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.\" David had prayed, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\" And through Ezekiel the promise had been given, \"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes.\" Isaiah 64:6; Psalm 51:10; Ezekiel 36:26, 27.",
