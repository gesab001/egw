    "word": "Isaiah's rapt portrayals of the Messiah's glory were his study by day and by night,--the Branch from the root of Jesse; a King to reign in righteousness, judging \"with equity for the meek of the earth;\" \"a covert from the tempest; . . . the shadow of a great rock in a weary land;\" Israel no longer to be termed \"Forsaken,\" nor her land \"Desolate,\" but to be called of the Lord, \"My Delight,\" and her land \"Beulah.\" Isaiah 11:4; 32:2; 62:4, margin. The heart of the lonely exile was filled with the glorious vision.",
