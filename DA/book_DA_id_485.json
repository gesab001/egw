    "word": "The soul of the prophet, emptied of self, was filled with the light of the divine. As he witnessed to the Saviour's glory, his words were almost a counterpart of those that Christ Himself had spoken in His interview with Nicodemus. John said, \"He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: He that cometh from heaven is above all. . . . For He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him.\" Christ could say, \"I seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent Me.\" John 5:30. To Him it is declared, \"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.\" Hebrews 1:9. The Father \"giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him.\"",
