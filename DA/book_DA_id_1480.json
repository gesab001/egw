    "word": "However much a shepherd may love his sheep, he loves his sons and daughters more. Jesus is not only our shepherd; He is our \"everlasting Father.\" And He says, \"I know Mine own, and Mine own know Me, even as the Father knoweth Me, and I know the Father.\" John 10:14, 15, R. V. What a statement is this!--the only-begotten Son, He who is in the bosom of the Father, He whom God has declared to be \"the Man that is My fellow\" (Zechariah 13:7),--the communion between Him and the eternal God is taken to represent the communion between Christ and His children on the earth!",
