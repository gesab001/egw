    "word": "So we may resist temptation, and force Satan to depart from us. Jesus gained the victory through submission and faith in God, and by the apostle He says to us, \"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.\" James 4:7, 8. We cannot save ourselves from the tempter's power; he has conquered humanity, and when we try to stand in our own strength, we shall become a prey to his devices; but \"the name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.\" Proverbs 18:10. Satan trembles and flees before the weakest soul who finds refuge in that mighty name.",
