    "word": "\"Be not therefore anxious for the morrow.\" Matthew 6:34, R. V. We are to follow Christ day by day. God does not bestow help for tomorrow. He does not give His children all the directions for their life journey at once, lest they should become confused. He tells them just as much as they can remember and perform. The strength and wisdom imparted are for the present emergency. \"If any of you lack wisdom,\"--for today,--\"let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" James 1:5.",
