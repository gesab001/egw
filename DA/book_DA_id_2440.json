    "word": "These went into the city, and appeared unto many, declaring, Christ has risen from the dead, and we be risen with Him. Thus was immortalized the sacred truth of the resurrection. The risen saints bore witness to the truth of the words, \"Thy dead men shall live, together with My dead body shall they arise.\" Their resurrection was an illustration of the fulfillment of the prophecy, \"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.\" Isaiah 26:19.",
