    "word": "The disciples of John had declared that all men were coming to Christ; but with clearer insight, John said, \"No man receiveth His witness;\" so few were ready to accept Him as the Saviour from sin. But \"he that hath received His witness hath set his seal to this, that God is true.\" John 3:33, R. V. \"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.\" No need of disputation as to whether Christ's baptism or John's purified from sin. It is the grace of Christ that gives life to the soul. Apart from Christ, baptism, like any other service, is a worthless form. \"He that believeth not the Son shall not see life.\"",
