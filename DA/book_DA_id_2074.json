    "word": "The disciples still failed to understand Christ's words in their spiritual sense, and again He explained His meaning. By the Spirit, He said, He would manifest Himself to them. \"The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things.\" No more will you say, I cannot comprehend. No longer will you see through a glass, darkly. You shall \"be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.\" Ephesians 3:18, 19.",
