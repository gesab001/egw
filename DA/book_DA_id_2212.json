    "word": "Christ's discourse in the synagogue concerning the bread of life was the turning point in the history of Judas. He heard the words, \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.\" John 6:53. He saw that Christ was offering spiritual rather than worldly good. He regarded himself as farsighted, and thought he could see that Jesus would have no honor, and that He could bestow no high position upon His followers. He determined not to unite himself so closely to Christ but that he could draw away. He would watch. And he did watch.",
