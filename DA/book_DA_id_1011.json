    "word": "There is another spiritual lesson in this miracle of the stilling of the tempest. Every man's experience testifies to the truth of the words of Scripture, \"The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest. . . . There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.\" Isaiah 57:20, 21. Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued, we can find no rest. The masterful passions of the heart no human power can control. We are as helpless here as were the disciples to quiet the raging storm. But He who spoke peace to the billows of Galilee has spoken the word of peace for every soul. However fierce the tempest, those who turn to Jesus with the cry, \"Lord, save us,\" will find deliverance. His grace, that reconciles the soul to God, quiets the strife of human passion, and in His love the heart is at rest. \"He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so He bringeth them unto their desired haven.\" Psalm 107:29, 30. \"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" \"The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever.\" Romans 5:1; Isaiah 32:17.",
