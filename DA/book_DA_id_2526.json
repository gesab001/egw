    "word": "John lived to be very aged. He witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem, and the ruin of the stately temple,--a symbol of the final ruin of the world. To his latest days John closely followed his Lord. The burden of his testimony to the churches was, \"Beloved, let us love one another;\" \"he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.\" 1 John 4:7, 16.",
