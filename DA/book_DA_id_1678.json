    "word": "In matters of conscience the soul must be left untrammeled. No one is to control another's mind, to judge for another, or to prescribe his duty. God gives to every soul freedom to think, and to follow his own convictions. \"Every one of us shall give account of himself to God.\" No one has a right to merge his own individuality in that of another. In all matters where principle is involved, \"let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.\" Romans 14:12, 5. In Christ's kingdom there is no lordly oppression, no compulsion of manner. The angels of heaven do not come to the earth to rule, and to exact homage, but as messengers of mercy, to co-operate with men in uplifting humanity.",
