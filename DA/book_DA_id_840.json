    "word": "Jesus did not let the matter pass without administering a rebuke to His enemies. He declared that in their blindness they had mistaken the object of the Sabbath. He said, \"If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.\" Matthew 12:7.
