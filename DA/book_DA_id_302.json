    "word": "When Satan quoted the promise, \"He shall give His angels charge over Thee,\" he omitted the words, \"to keep Thee in all Thy ways;\" that is, in all the ways of God's choosing. Jesus refused to go outside the path of obedience. While manifesting perfect trust in His Father, He would not place Himself, unbidden, in a position that would necessitate the interposition of His Father to save Him from death. He would not force Providence to come to His rescue, and thus fail of giving man an example of trust and submission.",
