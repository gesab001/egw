    "word": "Sorrow entered the peaceful home where Jesus had rested. Lazarus was stricken with sudden illness, and his sisters sent to the Saviour, saying, \"Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.\" They saw the violence of the disease that had seized their brother, but they knew that Christ had shown Himself able to heal all manner of diseases. They believed that He would sympathize with them in their distress; therefore they made no urgent demand for His immediate presence, but sent only the confiding message, \"He whom Thou lovest is sick.\" They thought that He would immediately respond to their message, and be with them as soon as He could reach Bethany.",
