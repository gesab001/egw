    "word": "Anciently, when a king journeyed through the less frequented parts of his dominion, a company of men was sent ahead of the royal chariot to level the steep places and to fill up the hollows, that the king might travel in safety and without hindrance. This custom is employed by the prophet to illustrate the work of the gospel. \"Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low.\" When the Spirit of God, with its marvelous awakening power, touches the soul, it abases human pride. Worldly pleasure and position and power are seen to be worthless. \"Imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God\" are cast down; every thought is brought into captivity \"to the obedience of Christ.\" 2 Corinthians 10:5. Then humility and self-sacrificing love, so little valued among men, are exalted as alone of worth. This is the work of the gospel, of which John's message was a part.",
