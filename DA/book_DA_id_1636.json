    "word": "Christ reproved Martha, but His words were spoken with the utmost gentleness. \"Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\" Why should you doubt in regard to My power? Why reason in opposition to My requirements? You have My word. If you will believe, you shall see the glory of God. Natural impossibilities cannot prevent the work of the Omnipotent One. Skepticism and unbelief are not humility. Implicit belief in Christ's word is true humility, true self-surrender.",
