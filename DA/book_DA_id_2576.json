    "word": "Christ had ascended to heaven in the form of humanity. The disciples had beheld the cloud receive Him. The same Jesus who had walked and talked and prayed with them; who had broken bread with them; who had been with them in their boats on the lake; and who had that very day toiled with them up the ascent of Olivet,--the same Jesus had now gone to share His Father's throne. And the angels had assured them that the very One whom they had seen go up into heaven, would come again even as He had ascended. He will come \"with clouds; and every eye shall see Him.\" \"The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise.\" \"The Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory.\" Revelation 1:7; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Matthew 25:31. Thus will be fulfilled the Lord's own promise to His disciples: \"If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.\" John 14:3. Well might the disciples rejoice in the hope of their Lord's return.",
