    "word": "By one who listened to these words, they were long afterward re-echoed in that sublime passage, \"In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.\" \"That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" John 1:4, 5, R. V., 9. And long after Jesus had ascended to heaven, Peter also, writing under the illumination of the divine Spirit, recalled the symbol Christ had used: \"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the daystar arise in your hearts.\" 2 Peter 1:19.",
