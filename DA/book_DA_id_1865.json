    "word": "The first four of the Ten Commandments are summed up in the one great precept, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.\" The last six are included in the other, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" Both these commandments are an expression of the principle of love. The first cannot be kept and the second broken, nor can the second be kept while the first is broken. When God has His rightful place on the throne of the heart, the right place will be given to our neighbor. We shall love him as ourselves. And only as we love God supremely is it possible to love our neighbor impartially.",
