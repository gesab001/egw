    "word": "Centuries before the Saviour's advent Moses had pointed to the Rock of Israel's salvation. The psalmist had sung of \"the Rock of my strength.\" Isaiah had written, \"Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation.\" Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 62:7; Isaiah 28:16. Peter himself, writing by inspiration, applies this prophecy to Jesus. He says, \"If ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious: unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious, ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house.\" 1 Peter 2:3-5, R. V.",
