    "word": "It is in doing Christ's work that the church has the promise of His presence. Go teach all nations, He said; \"and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\" To take His yoke is one of the first conditions of receiving His power. The very life of the church depends upon her faithfulness in fulfilling the Lord's commission. To neglect this work is surely to invite spiritual feebleness and decay. Where there is no active labor for others, love wanes, and faith grows dim.",
