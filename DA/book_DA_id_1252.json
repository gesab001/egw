    "word": "\"Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\" 1 Corinthians 3:11. \"Upon this rock,\" said Jesus, \"I will build My church.\" In the presence of God, and all the heavenly intelligences, in the presence of the unseen army of hell, Christ founded His church upon the living Rock. That Rock is Himself,--His own body, for us broken and bruised. Against the church built upon this foundation, the gates of hell shall not prevail.",
