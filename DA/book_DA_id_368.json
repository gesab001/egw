    "word": "And he who seeks to give light to others will himself be blessed. \"There shall be showers of blessing.\" \"He that watereth shall be watered also himself.\" Proverbs 11:25. God could have reached His object in saving sinners without our aid; but in order for us to develop a character like Christ's, we must share in His work. In order to enter into His joy,--the joy of seeing souls redeemed by His sacrifice,--we must participate in His labors for their redemption.",
