    "word": "\"If any man walk in the day,\" He continued, \"he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.\" He who does the will of God, who walks in the path that God has marked out, cannot stumble and fall. The light of God's guiding Spirit gives him a clear perception of his duty, and leads him aright till the close of his work. \"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.\" He who walks in a path of his own choosing, where God has not called him, will stumble. For him day is turned into night, and wherever he may be, he is not secure.",
