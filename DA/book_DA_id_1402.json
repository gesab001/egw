    "word": "The woman had stood before Jesus, cowering with fear. His words, \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone,\" had come to her as a death sentence. She dared not lift her eyes to the Saviour's face, but silently awaited her doom. In astonishment she saw her accusers depart speechless and confounded; then those words of hope fell upon her ear, \"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\" Her heart was melted, and she cast herself at the feet of Jesus, sobbing out her grateful love, and with bitter tears confessing her sins.",
