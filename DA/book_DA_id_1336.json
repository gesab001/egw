    "word": "In the ritual service, salt was added to every sacrifice. This, like the offering of incense, signified that only the righteousness of Christ could make the service acceptable to God. Referring to this practice, Jesus said, \"Every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.\" \"Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.\" All who would present themselves \"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God\" (Romans 12:1), must receive the saving salt, the righteousness of our Saviour. Then they become \"the salt of the earth,\" restraining evil among men, as salt preserves from corruption. Matthew 5:13. But if the salt has lost its savor; if there is only a profession of godliness, without the love of Christ, there is no power for good. The life can exert no saving influence upon the world. Your energy and efficiency in the upbuilding of My kingdom, Jesus says, depend upon your receiving of My Spirit. You must be partakers of My grace, in order to be a savor of life unto life. Then there will be no rivalry, no self-seeking, no desire for the highest place. You will have that love which seeks not her own, but another's wealth.",
