    "word": "\"The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,\" Jesus said. The institutions that God has established are for the benefit of mankind. \"All things are for your sakes.\" \"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.\" 2 Corinthians 4:15; 1 Corinthians 3:22, 23. The law of Ten Commandments, of which the Sabbath forms a part, God gave to His people as a blessing. \"The Lord commanded us,\" said Moses, \"to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive.\" Deuteronomy 6:24. And through the psalmist the message was given to Israel, \"Serve the Lord with gladness: come before His presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord He is God: it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture. Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise.\" Psalm 100:2-4. And of all who keep \"the Sabbath from polluting it,\" the Lord declares, \"Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer.\" Isaiah 56:6, 7.",
