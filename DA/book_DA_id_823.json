    "word": "\"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.\" Psalm 51:17. Man must be emptied of self before he can be, in the fullest sense, a believer in Jesus. When self is renounced, then the Lord can make man a new creature. New bottles can contain the new wine. The love of Christ will animate the believer with new life. In him who looks unto the Author and Finisher of our faith the character of Christ will be manifest.",
