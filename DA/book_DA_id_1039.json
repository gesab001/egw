    "word": "Peter, ever ready to speak, said, \"Master, the multitude throng Thee and press Thee, and sayest Thou, Who touched Me?\" Jesus answered, \"Somebody hath touched Me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of Me.\" The Saviour could distinguish the touch of faith from the casual contact of the careless throng. Such trust should not be passed without comment. He would speak to the humble woman words of comfort that would be to her a wellspring of joy,--words that would be a blessing to His followers to the close of time.",
