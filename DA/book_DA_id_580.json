    "word": "The Saviour continued: \"What things soever He [the Father] doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. . . . As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom He will.\" The Sadducees held that there would be no resurrection of the body; but Jesus tells them that one of the greatest works of His Father is raising the dead, and that He Himself has power to do the same work. \"The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.\" The Pharisees believed in the resurrection of the dead. Christ declares that even now the power which gives life to the dead is among them, and they are to behold its manifestation. This same resurrection power is that which gives life to the soul \"dead in trespasses and sins.\" Ephesians 2:1. That spirit of life in Christ Jesus, \"the power of His resurrection,\" sets men \"free from the law of sin and death.\" Philippians 3:10; Romans 8:2. The dominion of evil is broken, and through faith the soul is kept from sin. He who opens his heart to the Spirit of Christ becomes a partaker of that mighty power which shall bring forth his body from the grave.",
