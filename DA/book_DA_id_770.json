    "word": "Jesus was teaching in the house of Peter. According to their custom, His disciples sat close about Him, and \"there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem.\" These had come as spies, seeking an accusation against Jesus. Outside of these officials thronged the promiscuous multitude, the eager, the reverent, the curious, and the unbelieving. Different nationalities and all grades of society were represented. \"And the power of the Lord was present to heal.\" The Spirit of life brooded over the assembly, but Pharisees and doctors did not discern its presence. They felt no sense of need, and the healing was not for them. \"He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich He hath sent empty away.\" Luke 1:53.",
