    "word": "The question that Christ had put to Peter was significant. He mentioned only one condition of discipleship and service. \"Lovest thou Me?\" He said. This is the essential qualification. Though Peter might possess every other, yet without the love of Christ he could not be a faithful shepherd over the Lord's flock. Knowledge, benevolence, eloquence, gratitude, and zeal are all aids in the good work; but without the love of Jesus in the heart, the work of the Christian minister is a failure.",
