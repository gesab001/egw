    "word": "\"And now also,\" said the prophet, \"the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.\" Not by its name, but by its fruit, is the value of a tree determined.

Profession was worthless. If their life and character were not in harmony with God's law, they were not His people.",
