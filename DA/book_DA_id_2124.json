    "word": "And John, the loving disciple who had leaned upon the breast of Jesus, was asleep. Surely, the love of John for his Master should have kept him awake. His earnest prayers should have mingled with those of his loved Saviour in the time of His supreme sorrow. The Redeemer had spent entire nights praying for His disciples, that their faith might not fail. Should Jesus now put to James and John the question He had once asked them, \"Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\" they would not have ventured to answer, \"We are able.\" Matthew 20:22.",
