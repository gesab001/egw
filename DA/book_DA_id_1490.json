    "word": "But Jesus had \"steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.\" The one law of His life was the Father's will. In the visit to the temple in His boyhood, He had said to Mary, \"Wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business?\" Luke 2:49. At Cana, when Mary desired Him to reveal His miraculous power, His answer was, \"Mine hour is not yet come.\" John 2:4. With the same words He replied to His brothers when they urged Him to go to the feast. But in God's great plan the hour had been appointed for the offering of Himself for the sins of men, and that hour was soon to strike. He would not fail nor falter. His steps are turned toward Jerusalem, where His foes have long plotted to take His life; now He will lay it down. He set His face steadfastly to go to persecution, denial, rejection, condemnation, and death.",
