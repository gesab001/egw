    "word": "Continuing His answer to the disciples of John, Jesus spoke a parable, saying, \"No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.\" The message of John the Baptist was not to be interwoven with tradition and superstition.
