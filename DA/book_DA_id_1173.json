    "word": "Jesus told them plainly, \"There are some of you that believe not;\" adding, \"Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto Me, except it were given unto him of My Father.\" He wished them to understand that if they were not drawn to Him it was because their hearts were not open to the Holy Spirit. \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\" 1 Corinthians 2:14. It is by faith that the soul beholds the glory of Jesus. This glory is hidden, until, through the Holy Spirit, faith is kindled in the soul.",
