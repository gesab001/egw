    "word": "But to their question, \"Who art Thou?\" Jesus replied, \"Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.\" John 8:25, R.V. That which had been revealed in His words was revealed also in His character. He was the embodiment of the truths He taught. \"I do nothing of Myself,\" He continued; \"but as My Father hath taught Me, I speak these things. And He that sent Me is with Me: the Father hath not left Me alone; for I do always those things that please Him.\" He did not attempt to prove His Messianic claim, but showed His unity with God. If their minds had been open to God's love, they would have received Jesus.",
