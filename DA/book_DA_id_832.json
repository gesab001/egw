    "word": "No other institution which was committed to the Jews tended so fully to distinguish them from surrounding nations as did the Sabbath. God designed that its observance should designate them as His worshipers. It was to be a token of their separation from idolatry, and their connection with the true God. But in order to keep the Sabbath holy, men must themselves be holy. Through faith they must become partakers of the righteousness of Christ. When the command was given to Israel, \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" the Lord said also to them, \"Ye shall be holy men unto Me.\" Exodus 20:8;  22:31. Only thus could the Sabbath distinguish Israel as the worshipers of God.",
