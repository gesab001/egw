    "word": "After He had given the signs of His coming, Christ said, \"When ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.\" \"Take ye heed, watch and pray.\" God has always given men warning of coming judgments. Those who had faith in His message for their time, and who acted out their faith, in obedience to His commandments, escaped the judgments that fell upon the disobedient and unbelieving. The word came to Noah, \"Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before Me.\" Noah obeyed and was saved. The message came to Lot, \"Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city.\" Genesis 7:1; 19:14. Lot placed himself under the guardianship of the heavenly messengers, and was saved. So Christ's disciples were given warning of the destruction of Jerusalem. Those who watched for the sign of the coming ruin, and fled from the city, escaped the destruction. So now we are given warning of Christ's second coming and of the destruction to fall upon the world. Those who heed the warning will be saved.",
