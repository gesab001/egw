    "word": "Because He had rested upon the Sabbath, \"God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it,\"--set it apart to a holy use. He gave it to Adam as a day of rest. It was a memorial of the work of creation, and thus a sign of God's power and His love. The Scripture says, \"He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered.\" \"The things that are made,\" declare \"the invisible things of Him since the creation of the world,\" \"even His everlasting power and divinity.\" Genesis 2:3; Psalm 111:4; Romans 1:20, R.
