    "word": "Every soul that refuses to give himself to God is under the control of another power. He is not his own. He may talk of freedom, but he is in the most abject slavery. He is not allowed to see the beauty of truth, for his mind is under the control of Satan. While he flatters himself that he is following the dictates of his own judgment, he obeys the will of the prince of darkness. Christ came to break the shackles of sin-slavery from the soul. \"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.\" \"The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus\" sets us \"free from the law of sin and death.\" Romans 8:2.",
