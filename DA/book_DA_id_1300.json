    "word": "\"If Thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.\" How many a sin-burdened soul has echoed that prayer. And to all, the pitying Saviour's answer is, \"If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.\" It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us strength for coping with the powers of darkness. In Christ, God has provided means for subduing every sinful trait, and resisting every temptation, however strong. But many feel that they lack faith, and therefore they remain away from Christ. Let these souls, in their helpless unworthiness, cast themselves upon the mercy of their compassionate Saviour. Look not to self, but to Christ. He who healed the sick and cast out demons when He walked among men is the same mighty Redeemer today. Faith comes by the word of God. Then grasp His promise, \"Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out.\" John 6:37. Cast yourself at His feet with the cry, \"Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.\" You can never perish while you do this--never.",
