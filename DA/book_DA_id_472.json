    "word": "Like Nicodemus, we must be willing to enter into life in the same way as the chief of sinners. Than Christ, \"there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" Acts 4:12. Through faith we receive the grace of God; but faith is not our Saviour. It earns nothing. It is the hand by which we lay hold upon Christ, and appropriate His merits, the remedy for sin. And we cannot even repent without the aid of the Spirit of God. The Scripture says of Christ, \"Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.\" Acts 5:31. Repentance comes from Christ as truly as does pardon.",
