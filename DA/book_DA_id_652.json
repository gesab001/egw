    "word": "The time of Christ's coming, His anointing by the Holy Spirit, His death, and the giving of the gospel to the Gentiles, were definitely pointed out. It was the privilege of the Jewish people to understand these prophecies, and to recognize their fulfillment in the mission of Jesus. Christ urged upon His disciples the importance of prophetic study. Referring to the prophecy given to Daniel in regard to their time, He said, \"Whoso readeth, let him understand.\" Matthew 24:15. After His resurrection He explained to the disciples in \"all the prophets\" \"the things concerning Himself.\" Luke 24:27. The Saviour had spoken through all the prophets. \"The Spirit of Christ which was in them\" \"testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.\" 1 Peter 1:11.",
