    "word": "The observance of the Passover began with the birth of the Hebrew nation. On the last night of their bondage in Egypt, when there appeared no token of deliverance, God commanded them to prepare for an immediate release. He had warned Pharaoh of the final judgment on the Egyptians, and He directed the Hebrews to gather their families within their own dwellings. Having sprinkled the doorposts with the blood of the slain lamb, they were to eat the lamb, roasted, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. \"And thus shall ye eat it,\" He said, \"with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord's passover.\" Exodus 12:11. At midnight all the first-born of the Egyptians were slain. Then the king sent to Israel the message, \"Rise up, and get you forth from among my people; . . . and go, serve the Lord, as ye have said.\" Exodus 12:31. The Hebrews went out from Egypt an independent nation. The Lord had commanded that the Passover should be yearly kept. \"It shall come to pass,\" He said, \"when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians.\" Thus from generation to generation the story of this wonderful deliverance was to be repeated.",
