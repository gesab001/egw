    "word": "Jesus met Satan with the words of Scripture. \"It is written,\" He said. In every temptation the weapon of His warfare was the word of God. Satan demanded of Christ a miracle as a sign of His divinity. But that which is greater than all miracles, a firm reliance upon a \"Thus saith the Lord,\" was a sign that could not be controverted. So long as Christ held to this position, the tempter could gain no advantage.",
