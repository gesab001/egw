    "word": "Every moment added to the multitude upon the shore. Aged men leaning upon their staffs, hardy peasants from the hills, fishermen from their toil on the lake, merchants and rabbis, the rich and learned, old and young, bringing their sick and suffering ones, pressed to hear the words of the divine Teacher. To such scenes as this the prophets had looked forward, and they wrote: \n\n\n          \"The land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali, \n           Toward the sea, beyond Jordan, \n           Galilee of the Gentiles, \n           The people which sat in darkness \n           Saw a great light, \n           And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, \n           To them did light spring up.\" R. V.",
