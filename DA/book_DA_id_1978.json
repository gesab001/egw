    "word": "It is because this work is neglected that so many young disciples never advance beyond the mere alphabet of Christian experience.

The restless energy that is so often a source of danger to the young might be directed into channels through which it would flow out in streams of blessing. Self would be forgotten in earnest work to do others good.",
