    "word": "But the Saviour saw one case of supreme wretchedness. It was that of a man who had been a helpless cripple for thirty-eight years. His disease was in a great degree the result of his own sin, and was looked upon as a judgment from God.

His persistent efforts toward the one object, and his anxiety and continual disappointment, were fast wearing away the remnant of his strength.",
