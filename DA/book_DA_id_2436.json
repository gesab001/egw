    "word": "Over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, Christ had proclaimed in triumph, \"I am the resurrection, and the life.\" These words could be spoken only by the Deity. All created beings live by the will and power of God. They are dependent recipients of the life of God. From the highest seraph to the humblest animate being, all are replenished from the Source of life. Only He who is one with God could say, I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again. In His divinity, Christ possessed the power to break the bonds of death.",
