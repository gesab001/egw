    "word": "\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life.\" Through the beloved John, who listened to these words, the Holy Spirit declared to the churches, \"This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life.\" 1 John 5:11, 12. And Jesus said, \"I will raise him up at the last day.\" Christ became one flesh with us, in order that we might become one spirit with Him. It is by virtue of this union that we are to come forth from the grave,--not merely as a manifestation of the power of Christ, but because, through faith, His life has become ours. Those who see Christ in His true character, and receive Him into the heart, have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal.",
