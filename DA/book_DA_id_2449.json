    "word": "It was Christ Himself who had placed those graveclothes with such care. When the mighty angel came down to the tomb, he was joined by another, who with his company had been keeping guard over the Lord's body.

In His sight who guides alike the star and the atom, there is nothing unimportant. Order and perfection are seen in all His work.",
