    "word": "The Sermon on the Mount, though given especially to the disciples, was spoken in the hearing of the multitude. After the ordination of the apostles, Jesus went with them to the seaside. Here in the early morning the people had begun to assemble. Besides the usual crowds from the Galilean towns, there were people from Judea, and even from Jerusalem itself; from Perea, from Decapolis, from Idumea, away to the south of Judea; and from Tyre and Sidon, the Phoenician cities on the shore of the Mediterranean. \"When they had heard what great things He did,\" they \"came to hear Him, and to be healed of their diseases: . . . there went virtue out of Him, and healed them all.\" Mark 3:8; Luke 6:17-19.",
