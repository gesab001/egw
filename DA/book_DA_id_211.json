    "word": "Zacharias had expressed doubt of the angel's words. He was not to speak again until they were fulfilled. \"Behold,\" said the angel, \"thou shalt be dumb, . . . until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.\" It was the duty of the priest in this service to pray for the pardon of public and national sins, and for the coming of the Messiah; but when Zacharias attempted to do this, he could not utter a word.",
