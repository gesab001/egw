    "word": "Christ presented His future, illustrating it by the things of nature, that the disciples might understand. The true result of His mission was to be reached by His death. \"Verily, verily, I say unto you,\" He said, \"Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.\" When the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it springs up, and bears fruit. So the death of Christ would result in fruit for the kingdom of God. In accordance with the law of the vegetable kingdom, life was to be the result of His death.",
