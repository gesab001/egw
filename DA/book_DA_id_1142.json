    "word": "Jesus did not gratify their curiosity. He sadly said, \"Ye seek Me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.\" They did not seek Him from any worthy motive; but as they had been fed with the loaves, they hoped still to receive temporal benefit by attaching themselves to Him. The Saviour bade them, \"Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life.\" Seek not merely for material benefit. Let it not be the chief effort to provide for the life that now is, but seek for spiritual food, even that wisdom which will endure unto everlasting life. This the Son of God alone can give; \"for Him hath God the Father sealed.\"",
