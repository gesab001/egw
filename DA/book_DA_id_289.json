    "word": "In the last great conflict of the controversy with Satan those who are loyal to God will see every earthly support cut off. Because they refuse to break His law in obedience to earthly powers, they will be forbidden to buy or sell. It will finally be decreed that they shall be put to death. See Revelation 13:11-17. But to the obedient is given the promise, \"He shall dwell on high: his place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.\" Isaiah 33:16. By this promise the children of God will live. When the earth shall be wasted with famine, they shall be fed. \"They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.\" Psalm 37:19. To that time of distress the prophet Habakkuk looked forward, and his words express the faith of the church: \"Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.\" Habakkuk 3:17, 18.",
