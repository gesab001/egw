    "word": "Every soul is as fully known to Jesus as if he were the only one for whom the Saviour died. The distress of every one touches His heart. The cry for aid reaches His ear. He came to draw all men unto Himself. He bids them, \"Follow Me,\" and His Spirit moves upon their hearts to draw them to come to Him. Many refuse to be drawn. Jesus knows who they are. He also knows who gladly hear His call, and are ready to come under His pastoral care. He says, \"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.\" He cares for each one as if there were not another on the face of the earth.",
