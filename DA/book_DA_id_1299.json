    "word": "Jesus turns to the suffering one, and says, \"Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.\" There is a cry, an agonized struggle. The demon, in passing, seems about to rend the life from his victim. Then the boy lies motionless, and apparently lifeless. The multitude whisper, \"He is dead.\" But Jesus takes him by the hand, and lifting him up, presents him, in perfect soundness of mind and body, to his father. Father and son praise the name of their Deliverer. The multitude are \"amazed at the mighty power of God,\" while the scribes, defeated and crestfallen, turn sullenly away.",
