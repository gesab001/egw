    "word": "The neighbors of the young man, and those who knew him before in his blindness, said, \"Is not this he that sat and begged?\" They looked upon him with doubt; for when his eyes were opened, his countenance was changed and brightened, and he appeared like another man. From one to another the question passed.

He said, I know not.\"",
