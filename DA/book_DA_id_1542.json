    "word": "The lawyer's question to Jesus had been, \"What shall I do?\" And Jesus, recognizing love to God and man as the sum of righteousness, had said, \"This do, and thou shalt live.\" The Samaritan had obeyed the dictates of a kind and loving heart, and in this had proved himself a doer of the law. Christ bade the lawyer, \"Go, and do thou likewise.\" Doing, and not saying merely, is expected of the children of God. \"He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\" 1 John 2:6.",
