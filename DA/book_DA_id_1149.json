Moses, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, had said, \"Man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord.\" And the prophet Jeremiah had written, \"Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.\" Deuteronomy 8:3; Jeremiah 15:16. The rabbis themselves had a saying, that the eating of bread, in its spiritual significance, was the study of the law and the practice of good works; and it was often said that at the Messiah's coming all Israel would be fed.

Had they understood the Scriptures, they would have understood His words when He said, \"I am the bread of life.\" Only the day before, the great multitude, when faint and weary, had been fed by the bread which He had given. As from that bread they had received physical strength and refreshment, so from Christ they might receive spiritual strength unto eternal life. \"He that cometh to Me,\" He said, \"shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst.\" But He added, \"Ye also have seen Me, and believe not.\"",
