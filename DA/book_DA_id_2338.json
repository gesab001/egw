    "word": "I say unto thee today, Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise. Christ did not promise that the thief should be with Him in Paradise that day. He Himself did not go that day to Paradise. He slept in the tomb, and on the morning of the resurrection He said, \"I am not yet ascended to My Father.\" John 20:17. But on the day of the crucifixion, the day of apparent defeat and darkness, the promise was given. \"Today\" while dying upon the cross as a malefactor, Christ assures the poor sinner, Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise.",
