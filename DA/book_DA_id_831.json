    "word": "The Sabbath was not for Israel merely, but for the world. It had been made known to man in Eden, and, like the other precepts of the Decalogue, it is of imperishable obligation. Of that law of which the fourth commandment forms a part, Christ declares, \"Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in nowise pass from the law.\" So long as the heavens and the earth endure, the Sabbath will continue as a sign of the Creator's power. And when Eden shall bloom on earth again, God's holy rest day will be honored by all beneath the sun. \"From one Sabbath to another\" the inhabitants of the glorified new earth shall go up \"to worship before Me, saith the Lord.\" Matthew 5:18; Isaiah 66:23.",
