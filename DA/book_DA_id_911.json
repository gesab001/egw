    "word": "God has given us His holy precepts, because He loves mankind. To shield us from the results of transgression, He reveals the principles of righteousness. The law is an expression of the thought of God; when received in Christ, it becomes our thought. It lifts us above the power of natural desires and tendencies, above temptations that lead to sin. God desires us to be happy, and He gave us the precepts of the law that in obeying them we might have joy. When at Jesus' birth the angels sang,-- \n\n\n         \"Glory to God in the highest, \n          And on earth peace, good will toward men\" (Luke 2:14), \n\nthey were declaring the principles of the law which He had come to magnify and make honorable.",
