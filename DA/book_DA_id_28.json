    "word": "Had Israel been true to God, He could have accomplished His purpose through their honor and exaltation. If they had walked in the ways of obedience, He would have made them \"high above all nations which He hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor.\" \"All people of the earth,\" said Moses, \"shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord; and they shall be afraid of thee.\" \"The nations which shall hear all these statutes\" shall say, \"Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.\" Deuteronomy 26:19;  28:10; Deuteronomy 4:6. But because of their unfaithfulness, God's purpose could be wrought out only through continued adversity and humiliation.",
