    "word": "The Sabbath was embodied in the law given from Sinai; but it was not then first made known as a day of rest. The people of Israel had a knowledge of it before they came to Sinai. On the way thither the Sabbath was kept. When some profaned it, the Lord reproved them, saying, \"How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws?\" Exodus 16:28.",
