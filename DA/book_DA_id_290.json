    "word": "Of all the lessons to be learned from our Lord's first great temptation none is more important than that bearing upon the control of the appetites and passions.

Through intemperance, Satan works to destroy the mental and moral powers that God gave to man as a priceless endowment. Thus it becomes impossible for men to appreciate things of eternal worth. Through sensual indulgence, Satan seeks to blot from the soul every trace of likeness to God.",
