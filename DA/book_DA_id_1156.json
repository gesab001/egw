    "word": "In the words, \"They shall be all taught of God,\" Jesus referred to the prophecy of Isaiah: \"All thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.\" Isaiah 54:13. This scripture the Jews appropriated to themselves. It was their boast that God was their teacher. But Jesus showed how vain is this claim; for He said, \"Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto Me.\" Only through Christ could they receive a knowledge of the Father. Humanity could not endure the vision of His glory. Those who had learned of God had been listening to the voice of His Son, and in Jesus of Nazareth they would recognize Him who through nature and revelation has declared the Father.",
