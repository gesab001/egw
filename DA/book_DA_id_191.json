    "word": "There were some who sought His society, feeling at peace in His presence; but many avoided Him, because they were rebuked by His stainless life. Young companions urged Him to do as they did. He was bright and cheerful; they enjoyed His presence, and welcomed His ready suggestions; but they were impatient at His scruples, and pronounced Him narrow and strait-laced. Jesus answered, It is written, \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to Thy word.\" \"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against Thee.\" Psalm 119:9, 11.",
