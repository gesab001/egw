    "word": "The ordinances that point to our Lord's humiliation and suffering are regarded too much as a form. They were instituted for a purpose. Our senses need to be quickened to lay hold of the mystery of godliness. It is the privilege of all to comprehend, far more than we do, the expiatory sufferings of Christ. \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,\" even so has the Son of man been lifted up, \"that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.\" John 3:14, 15. To the cross of Calvary, bearing a dying Saviour, we must look. Our eternal interests demand that we show faith in Christ.",
