    "word": "The world, full of rioting, full of godless pleasure, is asleep, asleep in carnal security. Men are putting afar off the coming of the Lord. They laugh at warnings. The proud boast is made, \"All things continue as they were from the beginning.\" \"Tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.\" 2 Peter 3:4; Isaiah 56:12. We will go deeper into pleasure loving. But Christ says, \"Behold, I come as a thief.\" Revelation 16:15. At the very time when the world is asking in scorn, \"Where is the promise of His coming?\" the signs are fulfilling. While they cry, \"Peace and safety,\" sudden destruction is coming. When the scorner, the rejecter of truth, has become presumptuous; when the routine of work in the various money-making lines is carried on without regard to principle; when the student is eagerly seeking knowledge of everything but his Bible, Christ comes as a thief.",
