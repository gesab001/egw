    "word": "When the Saviour said, \"Go, . . . teach all nations,\" He said also, \"These signs shall follow them that believe; In My name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\" The promise is as far-reaching as the commission. Not that all the gifts are imparted to each believer. The Spirit divides \"to every man severally as He will.\" 1 Corinthians 12:11. But the gifts of the Spirit are promised to every believer according to his need for the Lord's work. The promise is just as strong and trustworthy now as in the days of the apostles. \"These signs shall follow them that believe.\" This is the privilege of God's children, and faith should lay hold on all that it is possible to have as an indorsement of faith.",
