    "word": "\"Blessed are the peacemakers.\" The peace of Christ is born of truth. It is harmony with God. The world is at enmity with the law of God; \n                                                                           305\nsinners are at enmity with their Maker; and as a result they are at enmity with one another. But the psalmist declares, \"Great peace have they which love Thy law: and nothing shall offend them.\" Psalm 119:165. Men cannot manufacture peace. Human plans for the purification and uplifting of individuals or of society will fail of producing peace, because they do not reach the heart. The only power that can create or perpetuate true peace is the grace of Christ. When this is implanted in the heart, it will cast out the evil passions that cause strife and dissension. \"Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree;\" and life's desert \"shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.\" Isaiah 55:13;  35:1.",
