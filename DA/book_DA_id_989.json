    "word": "\"Learn of Me,\" says Jesus; \"for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest.\" We are to enter the school of Christ, to learn from Him meekness and lowliness. Redemption is that process by which the soul is trained for heaven. This training means a knowledge of Christ. It means emancipation from ideas, habits, and practices that have been gained in the school of the prince of darkness. The soul must be delivered from all that is opposed to loyalty to God.",
