    "word": "Those who are true to their calling as messengers for God will not seek honor for themselves. Love for self will be swallowed up in love for Christ. No rivalry will mar the precious cause of the gospel. They will recognize that it is their work to proclaim, as did John the Baptist, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" John 1:29. They will lift up Jesus, and with Him humanity will be lifted up. \"Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\" Isaiah 57:15.",
