    "word": "\"That He might sanctify the people with His own blood,\" Christ \"suffered without the gate.\" Hebrews 13:12. For transgression of the law of God, Adam and Eve were banished from Eden. Christ, our substitute, was to suffer without the boundaries of Jerusalem. He died outside the gate, where felons and murderers were executed. Full of significance are the words, \"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.\" Galatians 3:13.",
