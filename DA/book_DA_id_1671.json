    "word": "The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who on earth has drunk most deeply of the spirit of His self-sacrificing love,--love that \"vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, . . . seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil\" (1 Corinthians 13:4, 5),--love that moves the disciple, as it moved our Lord, to give all, to live and labor and sacrifice, even unto death, for the saving of humanity. This spirit was made manifest in the life of Paul. He said, \"For to me to live is Christ;\" for his life revealed Christ to men; \"and to die is gain,\"--gain to Christ; death itself would make manifest the power of His grace, and gather souls to Him. \"Christ shall be magnified in my body,\" he said, \"whether it be by life or by death.\" Philippians 1:21, 20.",
