    "word": "But it was not only because of His human sympathy with Mary and Martha that Jesus wept. In His tears there was a sorrow as high above human sorrow as the heavens are higher than the earth. Christ did not weep for Lazarus; for He was about to call him from the grave. He wept because many of those now mourning for Lazarus would soon plan the death of Him who was the resurrection and the life. But how unable were the unbelieving Jews rightly to interpret His tears! Some, who could see nothing more than the outward circumstances of the scene before Him as a cause for His grief, said softly, \"Behold how He loved him!\" Others, seeking to drop the seed of unbelief into the hearts of those present, said derisively, \"Could not this Man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?\" If it were in Christ's power to save Lazarus, why then did He suffer him to die?",
