    "word": "Jesus walked alone with Peter, for there was something which He wished to communicate to him only. Before His death, Jesus had said to him, \"Whither I go, thou canst not follow Me now; but thou shalt follow Me afterwards.\" To this Peter had replied, \"Lord, why cannot I follow Thee now? I will lay down my life for Thy sake.\" John 13:36, 37. When he said this, he little knew to what heights and depths Christ's feet would lead the way. Peter had failed when the test came, but again he was to have opportunity to prove his love for Christ. That he might be strengthened for the final test of his faith, the Saviour opened to him his future. He told him that after living a life of usefulness, when age was telling upon his strength, he would indeed follow his Lord. Jesus said, \"When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. This spake He, signifying by what death he should glorify God.\"",
