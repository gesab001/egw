    "word": "Jesus came to \"destroy the works of the devil.\" \"In Him was life,\" and He says, \"I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" He is \"a quickening spirit.\" 1 John 3:8; John 1:4; 10:10; 1 Corinthians 15:45. And He still has the same life-giving power as when on earth He healed the sick, and spoke forgiveness to the sinner. He \"forgiveth all thine iniquities,\" He \"healeth all thy diseases.\" Psalm 103:3.",
