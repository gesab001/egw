    "word": "In the prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction Christ said, \"Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\" This prophecy will again be fulfilled. The abounding iniquity of that day finds its counterpart in this generation. So with the prediction in regard to the preaching of the gospel. Before the fall of Jerusalem, Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit, declared that the gospel was preached to \"every creature which is under heaven.\" Colossians 1:23. So now, before the coming of the Son of man, the everlasting gospel is to be preached \"to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.\" Revelation 14:6, 14. God \"hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world.\" Acts 17:31. Christ tells us when that day shall be ushered in. He does not say that all the world will be converted, but that \"this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\" By giving the gospel to the world it is in our power to hasten our Lord's return. We are not only to look for but to hasten the coming of the day of God. 2 Peter 3:12, margin. Had the church of Christ done her appointed work as the Lord ordained, the whole world would before this have been warned, and the Lord Jesus would have come to our earth in power and great glory.",
