    "word": "When Jesus entered the wilderness, He was shut in by the Father's glory. Absorbed in communion with God, He was lifted above human weakness. But the glory departed, and He was left to battle with temptation. It was pressing upon Him every moment. His human nature shrank from the conflict that awaited Him. For forty days He fasted and prayed. Weak and emaciated from hunger, worn and haggard with mental agony, \"His visage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men.\" Isaiah 52:14. Now was Satan's opportunity. Now he supposed that he could overcome Christ.",
