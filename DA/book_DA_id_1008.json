    "word": "When Jesus was awakened to meet the storm, He was in perfect peace. There was no trace of fear in word or look, for no fear was in His heart. But He rested not in the possession of almighty power. It was not as the \"Master of earth and sea and sky\" that He reposed in quiet. That power He had laid down, and He says, \"I can of Mine own self do nothing.\" John 5:30. He trusted in the Father's might. It was in faith--faith in God's love and care--that Jesus rested, and the power of that word which stilled the storm was the power of God.",
