    "word": "The work of Mary was just the lesson the disciples needed to show them that the expression of their love for Him would be pleasing to Christ.

He was often grieved because His disciples did not give Him that which He should have received from them. He knew that if they were under the influence of the heavenly angels that accompanied Him, they too would think no offering of sufficient value to declare the heart's spiritual affection.",
