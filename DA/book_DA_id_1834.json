    "word": "In infinite wisdom, God chose the foundation stone, and laid it Himself. He called it \"a sure foundation.\" The entire world may lay upon it their burdens and griefs; it can endure them all. With perfect safety they may build upon it. Christ is a \"tried stone.\" Those who trust in Him, He never disappoints. He has borne every test. He has endured the pressure of Adam's guilt, and the guilt of his posterity, and has come off more than conqueror of the powers of evil. He has borne the burdens cast upon Him by every repenting sinner. In Christ the guilty heart has found relief. He is the sure foundation. All who make Him their dependence rest in perfect security.",
