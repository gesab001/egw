But the possession of this knowledge was no ground for self-glorification. Through no wisdom or goodness of his own had it been revealed to Peter. Never can humanity, of itself, attain to a knowledge of the divine. \"It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?\" Job 11:8.

Ah, indeed, \"blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee.\"",
