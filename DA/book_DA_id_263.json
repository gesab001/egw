    "word": "None among the hearers, and not even the speaker himself, discerned the import of these words, \"the Lamb of God.\" Upon Mount Moriah, Abraham had heard the question of his son, \"My father, . . . where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\" The father answered, \"My son, God will provide Himself a lamb for a burnt offering.\" Genesis 22:7, 8. And in the ram divinely provided in the place of Isaac, Abraham saw a symbol of Him who was to die for the sins of men. The Holy Spirit through Isaiah, taking up the illustration, prophesied of the Saviour, \"He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,\" \"and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all\" (Isaiah 53:7, 6); but the people of Israel had not understood the lesson. Many of them regarded the sacrificial offerings much as the heathen looked upon their sacrifices,--as gifts by which they themselves might propitiate the Deity. God desired to teach them that from His own love comes the gift which reconciles them to Himself.",
