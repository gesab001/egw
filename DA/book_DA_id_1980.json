    "word": "When we realize that we are workers together with God, His promises will not be spoken with indifference. They will burn in our hearts, and kindle upon our lips. To Moses, when called to minister to an ignorant, undisciplined, and rebellious people, God gave the promise, \"My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.\" And He said, \"Certainly I will be with thee.\" Exodus 33:14; 3:12. This promise is to all who labor in Christ's stead for His afflicted and suffering ones.",
