    "word": "In the words, \"I am the light of the world,\" Jesus declared Himself the Messiah. The aged Simeon, in the temple where Christ was now teaching, had spoken of Him as \"a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.\" Luke 2:32. In these words he was applying to Him a prophecy familiar to all Israel. By the prophet Isaiah, the Holy Spirit had declared, \"It is too light a thing that Thou shouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth.\" Isaiah 49:6, R. V. This prophecy was generally understood as spoken of the Messiah, and when Jesus said, \"I am the light of the world,\" the people could not fail to recognize His claim to be the Promised One.",
