    "word": "Wonderful in its significance is the brief record of His early life: \"The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.\" In the sunlight of His Father's countenance, Jesus \"increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\" Luke 2:52. His mind was active and penetrating, with a thoughtfulness and wisdom beyond His years. Yet His character was beautiful in its symmetry. The powers of mind and body developed gradually, in keeping with the laws of childhood.",
