    "word": "The cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is still going forth, and it appeals to us with even greater power than to those who heard it in the temple on that last day of the feast. The fountain is open for all. The weary and exhausted ones are offered the refreshing draught of eternal life. Jesus is still crying, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.\" \"Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\" \"Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" Revelation 22:17; John 4:14.",
