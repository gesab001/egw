    "word": "The thieves crucified with Jesus were placed \"on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.\" This was done by the direction of the priests and rulers. Christ's position between the thieves was to indicate that He was the greatest criminal of the three. Thus was fulfilled the scripture, \"He was numbered with the transgressors.\" Isaiah 53:12. But the full meaning of their act the priests did not see. As Jesus, crucified with the thieves, was placed \"in the midst,\" so His cross was placed in the midst of a world lying in sin. And the words of pardon spoken to the penitent thief kindled a light that will shine to the earth's remotest bounds.",
