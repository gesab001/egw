    "word": "Those who desired a sign from Jesus had so hardened their hearts in unbelief that they did not discern in His character the likeness of God. They would not see that His mission was in fulfillment of the Scriptures. In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Jesus said to the Pharisees, \"If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.\" Luke 16:31. No sign that could be given in heaven or earth would benefit them.",
