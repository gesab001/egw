    "word": "The Pharisees had gathered close about Jesus as He answered the question of the scribe. Now turning He put a question to them: \"What think ye of Christ? whose son is He?\" This question was designed to test their belief concerning the Messiah,--to show whether they regarded Him simply as a man or as the Son of God. A chorus of voices answered, \"The Son of David.\" This was the title which prophecy had given to the Messiah. When Jesus revealed His divinity by His mighty miracles, when He healed the sick and raised the dead, the people had inquired among themselves, \"Is not this the Son of David?\" The Syrophoenician woman, blind Bartimaeus, and many others had cried to Him for help, \"Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David.\" Matthew 15:22. While riding into Jerusalem He had been hailed with the joyful shout, \"Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.\" Matthew 21:9. And the little children in the temple had that day echoed the glad ascription. But many who called Jesus the Son of David did not recognize His divinity. They did not understand that the Son of David was also the Son of God.",
