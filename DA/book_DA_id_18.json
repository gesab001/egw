    "word": "In stooping to take upon Himself humanity, Christ revealed a character the opposite of the character of Satan. But He stepped still lower in the path of humiliation. \"Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\" Philippians 2:8. As the high priest laid aside his gorgeous pontifical robes, and officiated in the white linen dress of the common priest, so Christ took the form of a servant, and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. \"He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him.\" Isaiah 53:5.",
