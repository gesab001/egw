    "word": "The Jews honored Moses as the giver of the manna, ascribing praise to the instrument, and losing sight of Him by whom the work had been accomplished. Their fathers had murmured against Moses, and had doubted and denied his divine mission. Now in the same spirit the children rejected the One who bore the message of God to themselves. \"Then said Jesus unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven.\" The giver of the manna was standing among them. It was Christ Himself who had led the Hebrews through the wilderness, and had daily fed them with the bread from heaven. That food was a type of the real bread from heaven. The life-giving Spirit, flowing from the infinite fullness of God, is the true manna. Jesus said, \"The bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world.\" John 6:33, R. V.",
