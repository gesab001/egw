    "word": "As the shepherd goes before his sheep, himself first encountering the perils of the way, so does Jesus with His people. \"When He putteth forth His own sheep, He goeth before them.\" The way to heaven is consecrated by the Saviour's footprints. The path may be steep and rugged, but Jesus has traveled that way; His feet have pressed down the cruel thorns, to make the pathway easier for us. Every burden that we are called to bear He Himself has borne.",
