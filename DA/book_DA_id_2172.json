    "word": "\"Hereafter,\" said Jesus, \"shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\" In these words Christ presented the reverse of the scene then taking place. He, the Lord of life and glory, would be seated at God's right hand. He would be the judge of all the earth, and from His decision there could be no appeal. Then every secret thing would be set in the light of God's countenance, and judgment be passed upon every man according to his deeds.",
