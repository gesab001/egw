He had always the companionship of heavenly angels, who opened to him the prophecies concerning Christ, and the precious promises of Scripture.

To John the Baptist, as to those that came after him, was given the assurance, \"Lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the end.\" Matthew 28:20, R. V., margin.",
