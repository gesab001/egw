    "word": "After sending this judgment upon Egypt, the Lord said to Moses, \"Sanctify unto Me all the first-born, . . . both of man and of beast: it is Mine;\" \"for on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto Me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast: Mine shall they be: I am the Lord.\" Exodus 13:2; Numbers 3:13. After the tabernacle service was established, the Lord chose the tribe of Levi in the place of the first-born of all Israel to minister in the sanctuary. But the first-born were still to be regarded as the Lord's, and were to be bought back by a ransom.",
