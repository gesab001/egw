But what a contrast in the reception of the word! The people of the great heathen city trembled as they heard the warning from God. Kings and nobles humbled themselves; the high and the lowly together cried to the God of heaven, and His mercy was granted unto them. \"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,\" Christ had said, \"and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.\" Matthew 12:40, 41.",
