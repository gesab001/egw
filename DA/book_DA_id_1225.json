    "word": "\"O ye hypocrites,\" said Jesus, \"ye can discern the face of the sky,\"--by studying the sky they could foretell the weather,--\"but can ye not discern the signs of the times?\" Christ's own words, spoken with the power of the Holy Spirit that convicted them of sin, were the sign that God had given for their salvation. And signs direct from heaven had been given to attest the mission of Christ. The song of the angels to the shepherds, the star that guided the wise men, the dove and the voice from heaven at His baptism, were witnesses for Him.",
