    "word": "The yoke is placed upon the oxen to aid them in drawing the load, to lighten the burden. So with the yoke of Christ. When our will is swallowed up in the will of God, and we use His gifts to bless others, we shall find life's burden light. He who walks in the way of God's commandments is walking in company with Christ, and in His love the heart is at rest. When Moses prayed, \"Show me now Thy way, that I may know Thee,\" the Lord answered him, \"My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.\" And through the prophets the message was given, \"Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.\" Exodus 33:13, 14; Jeremiah 6:16. And He says, \"O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.\" Isaiah 48:18.",
