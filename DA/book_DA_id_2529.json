    "word": "Chap. 86 - Go Teach All Nations\n\n     Standing but a step from His heavenly throne, Christ gave the commission to His disciples. \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,\" He said. \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations.\" \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" Mark 16:15. Again and again the words were repeated, that the disciples might grasp their significance. Upon all the inhabitants of the earth, high and low, rich and poor, was the light of heaven to shine in clear, strong rays. The disciples were to be colaborers with their Redeemer in the work of saving the world.",
