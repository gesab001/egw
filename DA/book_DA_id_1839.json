    "word": "\"To them which stumble at the word, being disobedient,\" Christ is a rock of offense. But \"the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner.\" Like the rejected stone, Christ in His earthly mission had borne neglect and abuse. He was \"despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: . . . He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.\" Isaiah 53:3. But the time was near when He would be glorified. By the resurrection from the dead He would be declared \"the Son of God with power.\" Romans 1:4. At His second coming He would be revealed as Lord of heaven and earth. Those who were now about to crucify Him would recognize His greatness. Before the universe the rejected stone would become the head of the corner.",
