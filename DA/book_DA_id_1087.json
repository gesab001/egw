    "word": "Christ's words of compassion are spoken to His workers today just as surely as they were spoken to His disciples. \"Come ye yourselves apart, . . . and rest awhile,\" He says to those who are worn and weary. It is not wise to be always under the strain of work and excitement, even in ministering to men's spiritual needs; for in this way personal piety is neglected, and the powers of mind and soul and body are overtaxed. Self-denial is required of the disciples of Christ, and sacrifices must be made; but care must also be exercised lest through their overzeal Satan take advantage of the weakness of humanity, and the work of God be marred.",
