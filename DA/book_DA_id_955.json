    "word": "Jesus changed the mother's grief to joy when He gave back her son; yet the youth was but called forth to this earthly life, to endure its sorrows, its toils, and its perils, and to pass again under the power of death. But Jesus comforts our sorrow for the dead with a message of infinite hope: \"I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore, . . . and have the keys of hell and of death.\" \"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.\" Revelation 1:18; Hebrews 2:14, 15.",
