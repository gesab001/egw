    "word": "\"Herein is My Father glorified,\" said Jesus, \"that ye bear much fruit.\" God desires to manifest through you the holiness, the benevolence, the compassion, of His own character. Yet the Saviour does not bid the disciples labor to bear fruit. He tells them to abide in Him. \"If ye abide in Me,\" He says, \"and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\" It is through the word that Christ abides in His followers. This is the same vital union that is represented by eating His flesh and drinking His blood. The words of Christ are spirit and life. Receiving them, you receive the life of the Vine. You live \"by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" Matthew 4:4. The life of Christ in you produces the same fruits as in Him. Living in Christ, adhering to Christ, supported by Christ, drawing nourishment from Christ, you bear fruit after the similitude of Christ.",
