    "word": "Chap. 2 -The Chosen People\n\n     For more than a thousand years the Jewish people had awaited the Saviour's coming. Upon this event they had rested their brightest hopes. In song and prophecy, in temple rite and household prayer, they had enshrined His name. And yet at His coming they knew Him not. The Beloved of heaven was to them \"as a root out of a dry ground;\" He had \"no form nor comeliness;\" and they saw in Him no beauty that they should desire Him. \"He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.\" Isaiah 53:2; John 1:11.",
