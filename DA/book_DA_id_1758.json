    "word": "When the procession reached the brow of the hill, and was about to descend into the city, Jesus halted, and all the multitude with Him.

In stately grandeur it towered above all else, seeming to point toward heaven as if directing the people to the only true and living God. The temple had long been the pride and glory of the Jewish nation. The Romans also prided themselves in its magnificence.

Its strength, richness, and magnificence had made it one of the wonders of the world.",
