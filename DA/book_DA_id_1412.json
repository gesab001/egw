    "word": "God is light; and in the words, \"I am the light of the world,\" Christ declared His oneness with God, and His relation to the whole human family. It was He who at the beginning had caused \"the light to shine out of darkness.\" 2 Corinthians 4:6. He is the light of sun and moon and star. He was the spiritual light that in symbol and type and prophecy had shone upon Israel. But not to the Jewish nation alone was the light given. As the sunbeams penetrate to the remotest corners of the earth, so does the light of the Sun of Righteousness shine upon every soul.",
