    "word": "Turning to the disciples, Christ said, \"Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\" Many false messiahs will appear, claiming to work miracles, and declaring that the time of the deliverance of the Jewish nation has come. These will mislead many. Christ's words were fulfilled. Between His death and the siege of Jerusalem many false messiahs appeared. But this warning was given also to those who live in this age of the world. The same deceptions practiced prior to the destruction of Jerusalem have been practiced through the ages, and will be practiced again.",
