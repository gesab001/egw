    "word": "John did not fully understand the nature of the Messiah's kingdom. He looked for Israel to be delivered from her national foes; but the coming of a King in righteousness, and the establishment of Israel as a holy nation, was the great object of his hope. Thus he believed would be accomplished the prophecy given at his birth,-- \n\n\n      \"To remember His holy covenant; . . . \n      That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies \n      Might serve Him without fear, \n      In holiness and righteousness before Him, all the days of our \n      life.\"",
