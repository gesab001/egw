    "word": "The worldling may pronounce this sorrow a weakness; but it is the strength which binds the penitent to the Infinite One with links that cannot be broken. It shows that the angels of God are bringing back to the soul the graces that were lost through hardness of heart and transgression. The tears of the penitent are only the raindrops that precede the sunshine of holiness. This sorrow heralds a joy which will be a living fountain in the soul. \"Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God;\" \"and I will not cause Mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the Lord.\" Jeremiah 3:13, 12. \"Unto them that mourn in Zion,\" He has appointed to give \"beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\" Isaiah 61:3.",
