    "word": "The principle of the Baptist's own life of self-abnegation was the principle of the Messiah's kingdom.

They were looking for a Messiah who had not been promised. John saw that the Saviour's mission could win from them only hatred and condemnation. He, the forerunner, was but drinking of the cup which Christ Himself must drain to its dregs.",
