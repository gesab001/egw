    "word": "The Communion service points to Christ's second coming. It was designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples. Whenever they met together to commemorate His death, they recounted how \"He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is My blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom.\" In their tribulation they found comfort in the hope of their Lord's return. Unspeakably precious to them was the thought, \"As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till He come.\" 1 Corinthians 11:26.",
