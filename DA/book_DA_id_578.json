    "word": "Israel had chosen their own ways. They had not builded according to the pattern; but Christ, the true temple for God's indwelling, molded every detail of His earthly life in harmony with God's ideal. He said, \"I delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\" Psalm 40:8. So our characters are to be builded \"for an habitation of God through the Spirit.\" Ephesians 2:22. And we are to \"make all things according to the pattern,\" even Him who \"suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His steps.\" Hebrews 8:5; 1 Peter 2:21.",
