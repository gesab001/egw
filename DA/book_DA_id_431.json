    "word": "At the crucifixion of Christ, those who had thus been healed did not join with the rabble throng in crying, \"Crucify Him, crucify Him.\" Their sympathies were with Jesus; for they had felt His great sympathy and wonderful power. They knew Him to be their Saviour; for He had given them health of body and soul. They listened to the preaching of the apostles, and the entrance of God's word into their hearts gave them understanding. They became agents of God's mercy, and instruments of His salvation.",
