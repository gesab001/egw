    "word": "Pilate delivered Jesus again to the soldiers, and amid the jeers and insults of the mob He was hurried to the judgment hall of Herod. \"When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad.\" He had never before met the Saviour, but \"he was desirous to see Him of a long season, because he had heard many things of Him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by Him.\" This Herod was he whose hands were stained with the blood of John the Baptist. When Herod first heard of Jesus, he was terror-stricken, and said, \"It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead;\" \"therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.\" Mark 6:16; Matthew 14:2. Yet Herod desired to see Jesus. Now there was opportunity to save the life of this prophet, and the king hoped to banish forever from his mind the memory of that bloody head brought to him in a charger. He also desired to have his curiosity gratified, and thought that if Christ were given any prospect of release, He would do anything that was asked of Him.",
