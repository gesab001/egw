    "word": "With prophetic eye Christ saw the enmity of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. He knew that they were premeditating His death. He knew that some of those now apparently so sympathetic would soon close against themselves the door of hope and the gates of the city of God.

He knew that many now weeping for Lazarus would die in the siege of the city, and in their death there would be no hope.",
