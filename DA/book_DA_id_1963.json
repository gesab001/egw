    "word": "In that day Christ does not present before men the great work He has done for them in giving His life for their redemption. He presents the faithful work they have done for Him. To those whom He sets upon His right hand He will say, \"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye clothed Me: I was sick, and ye visited Me: I was in prison, and ye came unto Me.\" But those whom Christ commends know not that they have been ministering unto Him. To their perplexed inquiries He answers, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\"",
