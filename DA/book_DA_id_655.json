    "word": "As the message of Christ's first advent announced the kingdom of His grace, so the message of His second advent announces the kingdom of His glory. And the second message, like the first, is based on the prophecies. The words of the angel to Daniel relating to the last days were to be understood in the time of the end. At that time, \"many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.\" \"The wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.\" Daniel 12:4, 10. The Saviour Himself has given signs of His coming, and He says, \"When ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.\" \"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.\" \"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\" Luke 21:31, 34, 36.",
