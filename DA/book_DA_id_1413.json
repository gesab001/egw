    "word": "\"That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\" The world has had its great teachers, men of giant intellect and wonderful research, men whose utterances have stimulated thought, and opened to view vast fields of knowledge; and these men have been honored as guides and benefactors of their race. But there is One who stands higher than they. \"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God.\" \"No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.\" John 1:12, 18. We can trace the line of the world's great teachers as far back as human records extend; but the Light was before them. As the moon and the stars of the solar system shine by the reflected light of the sun, so, as far as their teaching is true, do the world's great thinkers reflect the rays of the Sun of Righteousness. Every gem of thought, every flash of the intellect, is from the Light of the world. In these days we hear much about \"higher education.\" The true \"higher education\" is that imparted by Him \"in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\" \"In Him was life; and the life was the light of men.\" Colossians 2:3; John 1:4. \"He that followeth Me,\" said Jesus, \"shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\"",
