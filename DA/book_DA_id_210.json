    "word": "The words of the angel, \"I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God,\" show that he holds a position of high honor in the heavenly courts. When he came with a message to Daniel, he said, \"There is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael [Christ] your Prince.\" Daniel 10:21. Of Gabriel the Saviour speaks in the Revelation, saying that \"He sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John.\" Revelation 1:1. And to John the angel declared, \"I am a fellow servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets.\" Revelation 22:9, R. V. Wonderful thought--that the angel who stands next in honor to the Son of God is the one chosen to open the purposes of God to sinful men.",
