    "word": "The means by which we can overcome the wicked one is that by which Christ overcame,--the power of the word. God does not control our minds without our consent; but if we desire to know and to do His will, His promises are ours: \"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\" \"If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching.\" John 8:32; 7:17, R. V. Through faith in these promises, every man may be delivered from the snares of error and the control of sin.",
