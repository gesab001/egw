    "word": "Jesus denied that the Jews were children of Abraham. He said, \"Ye do the deeds of your father.\" In mockery they answered, \"We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.\" These words, in allusion to the circumstances of His birth, were intended as a thrust against Christ in the presence of those who were beginning to believe on Him. Jesus gave no heed to the base insinuation, but said, \"If God were your Father, ye would love Me: for I proceeded forth and came from God.\"",
