    "word": "An earthquake marked the hour when Christ laid down His life, and another earthquake witnessed the moment when He took it up in triumph. He who had vanquished death and the grave came forth from the tomb with the tread of a conqueror, amid the reeling of the earth, the flashing of lightning, and the roaring of thunder. When He shall come to the earth again, He will shake \"not the earth only, but also heaven.\" \"The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage.\" \"The heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll;\" \"the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.\" But \"the Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.\" Hebrews 12:26; Isaiah 24:20; 34:4; 2 Peter 3:10; Joel 3:16.",
