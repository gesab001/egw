    "word": "The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of \"the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal.\" Romans 16:25, R. V. It was an unfolding of the principles that from eternal ages have been the foundation of God's throne. From the beginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man through the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to meet the terrible emergency. So great was His love for the world, that He covenanted to give His only-begotten Son, \"that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16.",
