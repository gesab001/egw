    "word": "It was the same presence of divine holiness that had caused the prophet Daniel to fall as one dead before the angel of God. He said, \"My comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.\" So when Isaiah beheld the glory of the Lord, he exclaimed, \"Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.\" Daniel 10:8; Isaiah 6:5. Humanity, with its weakness and sin, was brought in contrast with the perfection of divinity, and he felt altogether deficient and unholy. Thus it has been with all who have been granted a view of God's greatness and majesty.",
