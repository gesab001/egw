    "word": "All is terror and confusion. The priest is about to slay the victim; but the knife drops from his nerveless hand, and the lamb escapes. Type has met antitype in the death of God's Son. The great sacrifice has been made. The way into the holiest is laid open. A new and living way is prepared for all. No longer need sinful, sorrowing humanity await the coming of the high priest. Henceforth the Saviour was to officiate as priest and advocate in the heaven of heavens. It was as if a living voice had spoken to the worshipers: There is now an end to all sacrifices and offerings for sin. The Son of God is come according to His word, \"Lo, I come (in the volume of the Book it is written of Me,) to do Thy will, O God.\" \"By His own blood\" He entereth \"in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.\" Hebrews 10:7; 9:12.",
