    "word": "And how this is accomplished, Christ has shown us. By what means did He overcome in the conflict with Satan? By the word of God. Only by the word could He resist temptation. \"It is written,\" He said. And unto us are given \"exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.\" 2 Peter 1:4. Every promise in God's word is ours. \"By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\" are we to live. When assailed by temptation, look not to circumstances or to the weakness of self, but to the power of the word. All its strength is yours. \"Thy word,\" says the psalmist, \"have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against Thee.\" \"By the word of Thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.\" Psalm 119:11; 17:4.",
