    "word": "\"He that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.\" Jesus read the future of His disciples. He saw one brought to the scaffold, one to the cross, one to exile among the lonely rocks of the sea, others to persecution and death. He encouraged them with the promise that in every trial He would be with them. That promise has lost none of its force. The Lord knows all about His faithful servants who for His sake are lying in prison or who are banished to lonely islands. He comforts them with His own presence. When for the truth's sake the believer stands at the bar of unrighteous tribunals, Christ stands by his side. All the reproaches that fall upon him, fall upon Christ. Christ is condemned over again in the person of His disciple. When one is incarcerated in prison walls, Christ ravishes the heart with His love. When one suffers death for His sake, Christ says, \"I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore, . . . and have the keys of hell and of death.\" Revelation 1:18. The life that is sacrificed for Me is preserved unto eternal glory.",
