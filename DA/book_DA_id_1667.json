    "word": "Jesus bears tenderly with them, not rebuking their selfishness in seeking preference above their brethren. He reads their hearts, He knows the depth of their attachment to Him. Their love is not a mere human affection; though defiled by the earthliness of its human channel, it is an outflowing from the fountain of His own redeeming love. He will not rebuke, but deepen and purify. He said, \"Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\" They recall His mysterious words, pointing to trial and suffering, yet answer confidently, \"We are able.\" They would count it highest honor to prove their loyalty by sharing all that is to befall their Lord.",
