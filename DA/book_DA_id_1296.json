    "word": "Again the Prince of life and the prince of the powers of darkness had met on the field of battle,--Christ in fulfillment of His mission to \"preach deliverance to the captives, . . . to set at liberty them that are bruised\" (Luke 4:18), Satan seeking to hold his victim under his control. Angels of light and the hosts of evil angels, unseen, were pressing near to behold the conflict. For a moment, Jesus permitted the evil spirit to display his power, that the beholders might comprehend the deliverance about to be wrought.",
