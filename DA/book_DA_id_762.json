    "word": "The leaders at Jerusalem had sent out spies to find some pretext for putting Christ to death. He responded by giving them an evidence of His love for humanity, His respect for the law, and His power to deliver from sin and death. Thus He bore witness of them: \"They have rewarded Me evil for good, and hatred for My love.\" Psalm 109:5. He who on the mount gave the precept, \"Love your enemies,\" Himself exemplified the principle, not rendering \"evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing.\" Matthew 5:44; 1 Peter 3:9.",
