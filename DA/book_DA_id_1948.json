    "word": "Christ is coming with clouds and with great glory. A multitude of shining angels will attend Him. He will come to raise the dead, and to change the living saints from glory to glory. He will come to honor those who have loved Him, and kept His commandments, and to take them to Himself. He has not forgotten them nor His promise. There will be a relinking of the family chain. When we look upon our dead, we may think of the morning when the trump of God shall sound, when \"the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\" 1 Corinthians 15:52. A little longer, and we shall see the King in His beauty. A little longer, and He will wipe all tears from our eyes. A little longer, and He will present us \"faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy.\" Jude 24. Wherefore, when He gave the signs of His coming He said, \"When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.\"",
