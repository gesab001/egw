    "word": "When the question comes home to your heart, \"Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?\" let not your answer be the response of unbelief. When the disciples heard the Saviour's direction, \"Give ye them to eat,\" all the difficulties arose in their minds. They questioned, Shall we go away into the villages to buy food? So now, when the people are destitute of the bread of life, the Lord's children question, Shall we send for someone from afar, to come and feed them? But what said Christ? \"Make the men sit down,\" and He fed them there. So when you are surrounded by souls in need, know that Christ is there. Commune with Him. Bring your barley loaves to Jesus.",
