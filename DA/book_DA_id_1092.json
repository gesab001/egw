    "word": "\"Come ye yourselves apart,\" He bids us. If we would give heed to His word, we should be stronger and more useful. The disciples sought Jesus, and told Him all things; and He encouraged and instructed them. If today we would take time to go to Jesus and tell Him our needs, we should not be disappointed; He would be at our right hand to help us. We need more simplicity, more trust and confidence in our Saviour. He whose name is called \"The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace;\" He of whom it is written, \"The government shall be upon His shoulder,\" is the Wonderful Counselor. We are invited to ask wisdom of Him. He \"giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\" Isaiah 9:6; James 1:5.",
