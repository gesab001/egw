    "word": "Jesus pointed out the power of false teaching to destroy the appreciation and desire for truth. \"No man,\" He said, \"having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.\" All the truth that has been given to the world through patriarchs and prophets shone out in new beauty in the words of Christ. But the scribes and Pharisees had no desire for the precious new wine. Until emptied of the old traditions, customs, and practices, they had no place in mind or heart for the teachings of Christ. They clung to the dead forms, and turned away from the living truth and the power of God.",
