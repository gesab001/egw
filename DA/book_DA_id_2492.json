    "word": "But there is a brighter side to the picture. \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted.\" Let this thought be kept uppermost. In labor for the erring, let every eye be directed to Christ. Let the shepherds have a tender care for the flock of the Lord's pasture. Let them speak to the erring of the forgiving mercy of the Saviour. Let them encourage the sinner to repent, and believe in Him who can pardon. Let them declare, on the authority of God's word, \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" 1 John 1:9. All who repent have the assurance, \"He will have compassion upon us; He will subdue our iniquities; and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.\" Micah 7:19.",
