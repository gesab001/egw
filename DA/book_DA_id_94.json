    "word": "\"Behold,\" Simeon had said, \"this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against.\" They must fall who would rise again. We must fall upon the Rock and be broken before we can be uplifted in Christ. Self must be dethroned, pride must be humbled, if we would know the glory of the spiritual kingdom. The Jews would not accept the honor that is reached through humiliation. Therefore they would not receive their Redeemer. He was a sign that was spoken against.",
