    "word": "The Saviour bade His disciples not to hope that the world's enmity to the gospel would be overcome, and that after a time its opposition would cease. He said, \"I came not to send peace, but a sword.\" This creating of strife is not the effect of the gospel, but the result of opposition to it. Of all persecution the hardest to bear is variance in the home, the estrangement of dearest earthly friends.

And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after Me, is not worthy of Me.\"",
