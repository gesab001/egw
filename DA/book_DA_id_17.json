    "word": "By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave us an example of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us power to obey. It was Christ who from the bush on Mount Horeb spoke to Moses saying, \"I AM THAT I AM. . . . Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.\" Exodus 3:14. This was the pledge of Israel's deliverance. So when He came \"in the likeness of men,\" He declared Himself the I AM. The Child of Bethlehem, the meek and lowly Saviour, is God \"manifest in the flesh.\" 1 Timothy 3:16. And to us He says: \"I AM the Good Shepherd.\" \"I AM the living Bread.\" \"I AM the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\" \"All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\" John 10:11; 6:51; 14:6; Matthew 28:18. I AM the assurance of every promise. I AM; be not afraid. \"God with us\" is the surety of our deliverance from sin, the assurance of our power to obey the law of heaven.",
