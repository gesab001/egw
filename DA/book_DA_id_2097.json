A profession of religion places men in the church, but the character and conduct show whether they are in connection with Christ. If they bear no fruit, they are false branches. Their separation from Christ involves a ruin as complete as that represented by the dead branch. \"If a man abide not in Me,\" said Christ, \"he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.\"",
