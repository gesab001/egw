    "word": "Jesus said to him, \"Friend, wherefore art thou come?\" His voice trembled with sorrow as He added, \"Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?\" This appeal should have aroused the conscience of the betrayer, and touched his stubborn heart; but honor, fidelity, and human tenderness had forsaken him. He stood bold and defiant, showing no disposition to relent. He had given himself up to Satan, and he had no power to resist him. Jesus did not refuse the traitor's kiss.",
