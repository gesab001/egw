    "word": "The mission of Christ's servants is a high honor, and a sacred trust. \"He that receiveth you,\" He says, \"receiveth Me, and he that receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me.\" No act of kindness shown to them in His name will fail to be recognized and rewarded. And in the same tender recognition He includes the feeblest and lowliest of the family of God: \"Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones\"--those who are as children in their faith and their knowledge of Christ--\"a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in nowise lose his reward.\"",
