    "word": "Moses upon the mount of transfiguration was a witness to Christ's victory over sin and death. He represented those who shall come forth from the grave at the resurrection of the just. Elijah, who had been translated to heaven without seeing death, represented those who will be living upon the earth at Christ's second coming, and who will be \"changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump;\" when \"this mortal must put on immortality,\" and \"this corruptible must put on incorruption.\" 1 Corinthians 15:51-53. Jesus was clothed with the light of heaven, as He will appear when He shall come \"the second time without sin unto salvation.\" For He will come \"in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.\" Hebrews 9:28; Mark 8:38. The Saviour's promise to the disciples was now fulfilled. Upon the mount the future kingdom of glory was represented in miniature,--Christ the King, Moses a representative of the risen saints, and Elijah of the translated ones.",
