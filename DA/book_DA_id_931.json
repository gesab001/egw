    "word": "\"If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.\" Purity and steadfastness of purpose are the conditions of receiving light from God.

To be wavering and halfhearted in allegiance to truth is to choose the darkness of error and satanic delusion.",
