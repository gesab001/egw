    "word": "When Satan and the Son of God first met in conflict, Christ was the commander of the heavenly hosts; and Satan, the leader of revolt in heaven, was cast out. Now their condition is apparently reversed, and Satan makes the most of his supposed advantage. One of the most powerful of the angels, he says, has been banished from heaven. The appearance of Jesus indicates that He is that fallen angel, forsaken by God, and deserted by man. A divine being would be able to sustain his claim by working a miracle; \"if Thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.\" Such an act of creative power, urges the tempter, would be conclusive evidence of divinity. It would bring the controversy to an end.",
