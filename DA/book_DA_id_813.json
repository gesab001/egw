    "word": "The Pharisees sought to exalt themselves by their rigorous observance of forms, while their hearts were filled with envy and strife. \"Behold,\" says the Scripture, \"ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?\" Isaiah 58:4, 5.",
