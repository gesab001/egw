    "word": "The religion of Christ is sincerity itself. Zeal for God's glory is the motive implanted by the Holy Spirit; and only the effectual working of the Spirit can implant this motive. Only the power of God can banish self-seeking and hypocrisy. This change is the sign of His working. When the faith we accept destroys selfishness and pretense, when it leads us to seek God's glory and not our own, we may know that it is of the right order. \"Father, glorify Thy name\" (John 12:28), was the keynote of Christ's life, and if we follow Him, this will be the keynote of our life. He commands us to \"walk, even as He walked;\" and \"hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.\" 1 John 2:6, 3.",
