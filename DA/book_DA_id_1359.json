    "word": "\"Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. The world cannot hate you; but Me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for My time is not yet full come. When He had said these words unto them, He abode still in Galilee.\" His brothers had spoken to Him in a tone of authority, prescribing the course He should pursue. He cast their rebuke back to them, classing them not with His self-denying disciples, but with the world. \"The world cannot hate you,\" He said, \"but Me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.\" The world does not hate those who are like it in spirit; it loves them as its own.",
