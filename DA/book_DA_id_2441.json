    "word": "To the believer, Christ is the resurrection and the life. In our Saviour the life that was lost through sin is restored; for He has life in Himself to quicken whom He will. He is invested with the right to give immortality. The life that He laid down in humanity, He takes up again, and gives to humanity. \"I am come,\" He said, \"that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\" \"Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" \"Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\" John 10:10; 4:14; John 6:54.",
