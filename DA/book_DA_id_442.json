The earthly priesthood ceased; but we look to Jesus, the minister of the new covenant, and \"to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.\" \"The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: . . . but Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, . . . by His own blood He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.\" Hebrews 12:24;  9:8-12.",
