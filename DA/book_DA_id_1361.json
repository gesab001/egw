    "word": "From Jerusalem the report of Christ's miracles had spread wherever the Jews were dispersed; and although for many months He had been absent from the feasts, the interest in Him had not abated.

The Pharisees and rulers looked for Him to come, hoping for an opportunity to condemn Him. They anxiously inquired, \"Where is He?\" but no one knew. The thought of Him was uppermost in all minds.

Many defended Him as one sent from God, while others denounced Him as a deceiver of the people.",
