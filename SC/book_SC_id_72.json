{"word": "After Adam and Eve had eaten of the forbidden fruit, they were filled with a sense of shame and terror. At first their only thought was how to excuse their sin and escape the dreaded sentence of death. When the Lord inquired concerning their sin, Adam replied, laying the guilt partly upon God and partly upon his companion: \"The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.\" The woman put the blame upon the serpent, saying, \"The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\" Genesis 3:12, 13. Why did You make the serpent? Why did You suffer him to come into Eden? These were the questions implied in her excuse for her sin, thus charging God with the responsibility of their fall. The spirit of self-justification originated in the father of lies and has been exhibited by all the sons and daughters of Adam. Confessions of this order are not inspired by the divine Spirit and will not be acceptable to God. True repentance will lead a man to bear his guilt himself and acknowledge it without deception or hypocrisy. Like the poor publican, not lifting up so much as his eyes unto heaven, he will cry, \"God be \n                                                                           41\nmerciful to me a sinner,\" and those who do acknowledge their guilt will be justified, for Jesus will plead His blood in behalf of the repentant soul.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 40}
