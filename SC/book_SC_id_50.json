{"word": "If you see your sinfulness, do not wait to make yourself better. How many there are who think they are not good enough to come to Christ. Do you expect to become better through your own efforts? \"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.\" Jeremiah 13:23. There is help for us only in God. We must not wait for stronger persuasions, for better opportunities, or for holier tempers. We can do nothing of ourselves. We must come to Christ just as we are.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 31}
