{"word": "Jesus prayed for us, and He asked that we might be one with Him, even as He is one with the Father. What a union is this! The Saviour has said of Himself, \"The Son can do nothing of Himself;\" \"the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works.\" John 5:19; 14:10. Then if Christ is dwelling in our hearts, He will work in us \"both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Philippians 2:13. We shall work as He worked; we shall manifest the same spirit. And thus, loving Him and abiding in Him, we shall \"grow up into Him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.\" Ephesians 4:15.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 75}
