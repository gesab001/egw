{"word": "In giving ourselves to God, we must necessarily give up all that would separate us from Him. Hence the Saviour says, \"Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple.\" Luke 14:33. Whatever shall draw away the heart from God must be given up. Mammon is the idol of many. The love of money, the desire for wealth, is the golden chain that binds them to Satan. Reputation and worldly honor are worshiped by another class. The life of selfish ease and freedom from responsibility is the idol of others. But these slavish bands must be broken. We cannot be half the Lord's and half the world's. We are not God's children unless we are such entirely.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 44}
