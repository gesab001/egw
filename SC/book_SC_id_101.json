He desires to take every glimmer of hope and every ray of light from the soul; but you must not permit him to do this. Do not give ear to the tempter, but say, \"Jesus has died that I might live. He loves me, and wills not that I should perish. I have a compassionate heavenly Father; and although I have abused His love, though the blessings He has given me have been squandered, I will arise, and go to my Father, and say, 'I have sinned against heaven, and before Thee, and am no more worthy to be called Thy son: make me as one of Thy hired servants.'\" The parable tells you how \n                                                                           54\nthe wanderer will be received: \"When he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\" Luke 15:18-20.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 53}
