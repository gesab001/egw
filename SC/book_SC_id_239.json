{"word": "Chap. 13 - Rejoicing in the Lord\n\n     The children of God are called to be representatives of Christ, showing forth the goodness and mercy of the Lord. As Jesus has revealed to us the true character of the Father, so we are to reveal Christ to a world that does not know His tender, pitying love. \"As Thou hast sent Me into the world,\" said Jesus, \"even so have I also sent them into the world.\" \"I in them, and Thou in Me; . . . that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me.\" John 17:18, 23. The apostle Paul says to the disciples of Jesus, \"Ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ,\" \"known and read of all men.\" 2 Corinthians 3:3, 2. In every one of His children, Jesus sends a letter to the world. If you are Christ's follower, He sends in you a letter to the family, the village, the street, where you live. Jesus, dwelling in you, desires to speak to the hearts of those who are not acquainted with Him. Perhaps they do not read the Bible, or do not hear the voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see the love of God through His works. But if you are a true representative of Jesus, it may be that through you they will be led to understand something of His goodness and be won to love and serve Him.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 115}
