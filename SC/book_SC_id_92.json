{"word": "From the simple Bible account of how Jesus healed the sick, we may learn something about how to believe in Him for the forgiveness of sins. Let us turn to the story of the paralytic at Bethesda. The poor sufferer was helpless; he had not used his limbs for thirty-eight years. Yet Jesus bade him, \"Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\" The sick man might have said, \"Lord, if Thou wilt make me whole, I will obey Thy word.\" But, no, he believed Christ's word, believed that he was made whole, and he made the effort at once; he willed to walk, and he did walk. He acted on the word of Christ, and God gave the power. He was made whole. \n                                                                           51", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 50}
