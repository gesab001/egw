{"word": "There are certain conditions upon which we may expect that God will hear and answer our prayers. One of the first of these is that we feel our need of help from Him. He has promised, \"I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.\" Isaiah 44:3. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, who long after God, may be sure that they will be filled. The heart must be open to the Spirit's influence, or God's blessing cannot be received.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 95}
