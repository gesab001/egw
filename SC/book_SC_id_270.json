{"word": "In view of the glorious inheritance that may be his, \"what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\" Matthew 16:26. He may be poor, yet he possesses in himself a wealth and dignity that the world could never bestow. The soul redeemed and cleansed from sin, with all its noble powers dedicated to the service of God, is of surpassing worth; and there is joy in heaven in the presence of God and the holy angels over one soul redeemed, a joy that is expressed in songs of holy triumph.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 126}
