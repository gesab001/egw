{"word": "The examples in God's word of genuine repentance and humiliation reveal a spirit of confession in which there is no excuse for sin or attempt at self-justification. Paul did not seek to shield himself; he paints his sin in its darkest hue, not attempting to lessen his guilt. He says, \"Many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.\" Acts 26:10, 11. He does not hesitate to declare that \"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\" 1 Timothy 1:15.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 41}
