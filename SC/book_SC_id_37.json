{"word": "The Bible does not teach that the sinner must repent before he can heed the invitation of Christ, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" Matthew 11:28. It is the virtue that goes forth from Christ, that leads to genuine repentance. Peter made the matter clear in his statement to the Israelites when he said, \"Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.\" Acts 5:31. We can no more repent without the Spirit of Christ to awaken the conscience than we can be pardoned without Christ.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 26}
