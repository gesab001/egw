{"word": "Jesus says, \"Abide in Me.\" These words convey the idea of rest, stability, confidence. Again He invites,\"Come unto Me, . . . and I will give you rest.\" Matthew 11:28. The words of the psalmist express the same thought: \"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him.\" And Isaiah gives the assurance, \"In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.\" Psalm 37:7; Isaiah 30:15. This rest is not found in inactivity; for in the Saviour's invitation the promise of rest is united with the call to labor: \"Take My yoke upon you: . . . and ye shall find rest.\" Matthew 11:29. The heart that rests most fully upon Christ will be most earnest and active in labor for Him.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 71}
