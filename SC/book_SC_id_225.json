{"word": "The apostle Peter says that there are in Scripture \"things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest . . . unto their own destruction.\" 2 Peter 3:16. The difficulties of Scripture have been urged by skeptics as an argument against the Bible; but so far from this, they constitute a strong evidence of its divine inspiration. If it contained no account of God but that which we could easily comprehend; if His greatness and majesty could be grasped by finite minds, then the Bible would not bear the unmistakable credentials of divine authority. The very grandeur and mystery of the themes presented should inspire faith in it as the word of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 107}
