{"word": "The psalmist says, \"Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.\" Psalm 37:3. \"Trust in the Lord.\" Each day has its burdens, its cares and perplexities; and when we meet how ready we are to talk of our difficulties and trials. So many borrowed troubles intrude, so many fears are indulged, such a weight of anxiety is expressed, that one might suppose we had no pitying, loving Saviour ready to hear all our requests and to be to us a present help in every time of need.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 121}
