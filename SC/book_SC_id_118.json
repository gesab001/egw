Jesus said of Himself before He came to earth, \"I delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\" Psalm 40:8. And just before He ascended again to heaven He declared, \"I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.\" John 15:10. The Scripture says, \"Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. . . . He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk even as He walked.\" 1 John 2:3-6. \"Because Christ also \n                                                                           62\nsuffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His steps.\" 1 Peter 2:21.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 61}
