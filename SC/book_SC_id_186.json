{"word": "Never should the Bible be studied without prayer. Before opening its pages we should ask for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, and it will be given. When Nathanael came to Jesus, the Saviour exclaimed, \"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\" Nathanael said, \"Whence knowest Thou me?\" Jesus answered, \"Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.\" John 1:47, 48. And Jesus will see us also in the secret places of prayer if we will seek Him for light that we may know what is truth. Angels from the world of light will be with those who in humility of heart seek for divine guidance.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 91}
