{"word": "Many accept an intellectual religion, a form of godliness, when the heart is not cleansed. Let it be your prayer, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.\" Psalm 51:10. Deal truly with your own soul. Be as earnest, as persistent, as you would be if your mortal life were at stake. This is a matter to be settled between God and your own soul, settled for eternity. A supposed hope, and nothing more, will prove your ruin.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 35}
