{"word": "It is peace that you need--Heaven's forgiveness and peace and love in the soul. Money cannot buy it, intellect cannot procure it, wisdom cannot attain to it; you can never hope, by your own efforts, to secure it. But God offers it to you as a gift, \"without money and without price.\" Isaiah 55:1. It is yours if you will but reach out your hand and grasp it. The Lord says, \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\" Isaiah 1:18. \"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.\" Ezekiel 36:26.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 49}
