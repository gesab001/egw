{"word": "The whole heart must be yielded to God, or the change can never be wrought in us by which we are to be restored to His likeness. By nature we are alienated from God. The Holy Spirit describes our condition in such words as these: \"Dead in trespasses and sins;\" \"the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint;\" \"no soundness in it.\" We are held fast in the snare of Satan, \"taken captive by him at his will.\" Ephesians 2:1; Isaiah 1:5, 6; 2 Timothy 2:26. God desires to heal us, to set us free. But since this requires an entire transformation, a renewing of our whole nature, we must yield ourselves wholly to Him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 43}
