{"word": "The word of God reveals His character. He Himself has declared His infinite love and pity. When Moses prayed, \"Show me Thy glory,\" the Lord answered, \"I will make all My goodness pass before thee.\" Exodus 33:18, 19. This is His glory. The Lord passed before Moses, and proclaimed, \"The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.\" Exodus 34:6, 7. He is \"slow to anger, and of great kindness,\" \"because He delighteth in mercy.\" Jonah 4:2; Micah 7:18.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 10}
