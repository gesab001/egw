{"word": "Jesus says, \"What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\" Mark 11:24. There is a condition to this promise--that we pray according to the will of God. But it is the will of God to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children, and to enable us to live a holy life. So we may ask for these blessings, and believe that we receive them, and thank God that we have received them. It is our privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed, and to stand before the law without shame or remorse. \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" Romans 8:1.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 51}
