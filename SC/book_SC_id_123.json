{"word": "When we speak of faith, there is a distinction that should be borne in mind. There is a kind of belief that is wholly distinct from faith. The existence and power of God, the truth of His word, are facts that even Satan and his hosts cannot at heart deny. The Bible says that \"the devils also believe, and tremble;\" but this is not faith. James 2:19. Where there is not only a belief in God's word, but a submission of the will to Him; where the heart is yielded to Him, the affections fixed upon Him, there is faith--faith that works by love and purifies the soul. Through this faith the heart is renewed in the image of God. And the heart that in its unrenewed state is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be, now delights in its holy precepts, exclaiming with the psalmist, \"O how love I Thy law! it is my meditation all the day.\" Psalm 119:97. And the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us, \"who \n                                                                           64\nwalk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" Romans 8:1.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 63}
