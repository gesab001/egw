{"word": "You have confessed your sins, and in heart put them away. You have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to Him, and ask that He will wash away your sins and give you a new heart. Then \n                                                                           50\nbelieve that He does this because He has promised. This is the lesson which Jesus taught while He was on earth, that the gift which God promises us, we must believe we do receive, and it is ours. Jesus healed the people of their diseases when they had faith in His power; He helped them in the things which they could see, thus inspiring them with confidence in Him concerning things which they could not see--leading them to believe in His power to forgive sins. This He plainly stated in the healing of the man sick with palsy: \"That ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith He to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.\" Matthew 9:6. So also John the evangelist says, speaking of the miracles of Christ, \"These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through His name.\" John 20:31.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 49}
