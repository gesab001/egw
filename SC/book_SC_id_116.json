{"word": "But notice here that obedience is not a mere outward compliance, but the service of love. The law of God is an expression of His very nature; it is an embodiment of the great principle of love, and hence is the foundation of His government in heaven and earth. If our hearts are renewed in the likeness of God, if the divine love is implanted in the soul, will not the law of God be carried out in the life? When the principle of love is implanted in the heart, when man is renewed after the image of Him that created him, the new-covenant promise is fulfilled, \"I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them.\" Hebrews 10:16. And if the law is written in the heart, will it not shape the life? Obedience--the service and allegiance of love--is the true sign of discipleship. Thus the Scripture says, \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\" \"He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" 1 John 5:3; 2:4. Instead of releasing man from obedience, it is faith, \n                                                                           61\nand faith only, that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render obedience.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 60}
