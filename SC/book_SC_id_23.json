{"word": "This is the same figure to which Christ referred in His conversation with Nathanael, when He said, \"Ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\" John 1:51. In the apostasy, man alienated himself from God; earth was cut off from heaven. Across the gulf that lay between, there could be no communion. But through Christ, earth is again linked with heaven. With His own merits, Christ has bridged the gulf which sin had made, so that the ministering angels can hold communion with man. Christ connects fallen man in his weakness and helplessness with the Source of infinite power. \n                                                                           21", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 20}
