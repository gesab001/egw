{"word": "God does not deal with us as finite men deal with one another. His thoughts are thoughts of mercy, love, and tenderest compassion. He says, \"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\" \"I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins.\" Isaiah 55:7; 44:22.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 53}
