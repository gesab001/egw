{"word": "God intends that even in this life the truths of His word shall be ever unfolding to His people. There is only one way in which this knowledge can be obtained. We can attain to an understanding of God's word only through the illumination of that Spirit by which the word was given. \"The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God;\" \"for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.\" 1 Corinthians 2:11, 10. And the Saviour's promise to His followers was, \"When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth. . . . For He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you.\" John 16:13, 14.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 109}
