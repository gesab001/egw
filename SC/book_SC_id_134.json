{"word": "Many have an idea that they must do some part of the work alone. They have trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sin, but now they seek by their own efforts to live aright. But every such effort must fail. Jesus says, \"Without Me ye can do nothing.\" Our growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness,--all depend upon our union with Christ. It is by communion with Him, daily, hourly,--by abiding in Him, --that we are to grow in grace. He is not only the Author, but the Finisher of our faith. It is Christ first and last and always. He is to be with us, not only at the beginning and the end of our course, but at every step of the way. David says, \"I have set the Lord always before me: because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.\" Psalm 16:8.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 69}
