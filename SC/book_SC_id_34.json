{"word": "The prayer of David after his fall, illustrates the nature of true sorrow for sin. His repentance was sincere and deep. There was no effort to palliate \n                                                                           25\nhis guilt; no desire to escape the judgment threatened, inspired his prayer. David saw the enormity of his transgression; he saw the defilement of his soul; he loathed his sin. It was not for pardon only that he prayed, but for purity of heart. He longed for the joy of holiness--to be restored to harmony and communion with God. This was the language of his soul: \n\n\n     \"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, \n          whose sin is covered. \n     Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord \n          imputeth not iniquity, \n     And in whose spirit there is no guile.\" \n                                Psalm 32:1, 2. \n     \"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to \n          Thy loving-kindness: \n     According unto the multitude of Thy tender \n          mercies blot out my transgressions. . . . \n     For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my \n          sin is ever before me. . . . \n     Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: \n          wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. . . . \n     Create in me a clean heart, O God; \n     And renew a right spirit within me. \n     Cast me not away from Thy presence; \n     And take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. \n     Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation; \n     And uphold me with Thy free spirit. . . . \n     Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou \n          God of my salvation: \n     And my tongue shall sing aloud of Thy \n          righteousness.\"       Psalm 51:1-14.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 24}
