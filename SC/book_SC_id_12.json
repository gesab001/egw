{"word": "Jesus said, \"Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I might take it again.\" John 10:17. That is, \"My Father has so loved you that He even loves Me more for giving My life to redeem you. In becoming your Substitute and Surety, by surrendering My life, by taking your liabilities, your transgressions, I am endeared to My Father; for by My sacrifice, God can be just, and yet the Justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 14}
