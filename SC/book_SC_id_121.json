You are to maintain this connection with Christ by faith and the continual surrender of your will to Him; and so long as you do this, He will work in you to will and to do \n                                                                           63\naccording to His good pleasure. So you may say, \"The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.\" Galatians 2:20. So Jesus said to His disciples, \"It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.\" Matthew 10:20. Then with Christ working in you, you will manifest the same spirit and do the same good works --works of righteousness, obedience.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 62}
