{"word": "The apostle Paul says that God \"hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.\" Colossians 1:13. And everyone who has passed from death unto life is able to \"set to his seal that God is true.\" John 3:33. He can testify, \"I needed help, and I found it in Jesus. Every want was supplied, the hunger of my soul was satisfied; and now the Bible is to me the revelation of Jesus Christ. Do you ask why I believe in Jesus? Because He is to me a divine Saviour. Why do I believe the Bible? Because I have found it to be the voice of God to my soul.\" We may have the witness in ourselves that the Bible is true, that Christ is the Son of God. We know that we are not following cunningly devised fables.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "SC", "page": 112}
