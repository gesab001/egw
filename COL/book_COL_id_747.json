{"word": "To us God's messengers come at the bidding of the Master. They come demanding, as did Christ, obedience to the word of God. They present His claim to the fruits of the vineyard, the fruits of love, and humility, and self-sacrificing service.

Such teachers God calls unfaithful servants.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 306}
