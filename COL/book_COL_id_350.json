{"word": "In harmony with this experience is the command, \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Philippians 2:12, 13. God does not bid you fear that He will fail to fulfill His promises, that His patience will weary, or His compassion be found wanting. Fear lest your will shall not be held in subjection to Christ's will, lest your hereditary and cultivated traits of character shall control your life. \"It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Fear lest self shall interpose between your soul and the great Master Worker. Fear lest self-will shall mar the high purpose that through you God desires to accomplish. Fear to trust to your own strength, fear to withdraw your hand from the hand of Christ and attempt to walk life's pathway without His abiding presence.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 161}
