{"word": "Before He left His disciples, Christ \"breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\" John 20:22. Again He said, \"Behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you.\" Luke 24:49. But not until after the ascension was the gift received in its fullness. Not until through faith and prayer the disciples had surrendered themselves fully for His working was the outpouring of the Spirit received. Then in a special sense the goods of heaven were committed to the followers of Christ. \"When He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.\" Ephesians 4:8. \"Unto every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ,\" the Spirit \"dividing to every man severally as He will.\" Ephesians 4:7; 1 Corinthians 12:11. The gifts are already ours in Christ, but their actual possession depends upon our reception of the Spirit of God. \n                                                                           328", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 327}
