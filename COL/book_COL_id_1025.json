{"word": "This parable does not excuse those who hear the first call to labor but who neglect to enter the Lord's vineyard. When the householder went to the market place at the eleventh hour and found men unemployed he said, \"Why stand ye here all the day idle?\" The answer was, \"Because no man hath hired us.\" None of those called later in the day were there in the morning. They had not refused the call. Those who refuse and afterward repent, do well to repent; but it is not safe to trifle with the first call of mercy.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 399}
