{"word": "It was taught by the Jews that before God's love is extended to the sinner, he must first repent. In their view, repentance is a work by which men earn the favor of Heaven. And it was this thought that led the Pharisees to exclaim in astonishment and anger. \"This man receiveth sinners.\" According to their ideas He should permit none to approach Him but those who had repented. But in the parable of the lost sheep, Christ teaches that salvation does not come through our seeking after God but through God's seeking after us. \"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way.\" Romans 3:11, 12. We do not repent in order that God may love us, but He reveals to us His love in order that we may repent.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 189}
