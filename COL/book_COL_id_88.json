{"word": "In Good Ground \n\n     The sower is not always to meet with disappointment. Of the seed that fell into good ground the Saviour said, This \"is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.\" \"That on the good ground are they, which, in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 58}
