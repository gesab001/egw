{"word": "Chap. 19 - The Measure of Forgiveness\n\n     Peter had come to Christ with the question, \"How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?\" The rabbis limited the exercise of forgiveness to three offenses.

Not \"Until seven times,\" He said, \"but, Until seventy times seven.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 243}
