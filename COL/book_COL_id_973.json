{"word": "The great difference between the Jews and the Samaritans was a difference in religious belief, a question as to what constitutes true worship. The Pharisees would say nothing good of the Samaritans, but poured their bitterest curses upon them. So strong was the antipathy between the Jews and the Samaritans that to the Samaritan woman it seemed a strange thing for Christ to ask her for a drink. \"How is it,\" she said, \"that Thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?\" \"For,\" adds the evangelist, \"the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.\" \n                                                                           381\nJohn 4:9. And when the Jews were so filled with murderous hatred against Christ that they rose up in the temple to stone Him, they could find no better words by which to express their hatred than, \"Say we not well that Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?\" John 8:48. Yet the priest and Levite neglected the very work the Lord had enjoined on them, leaving a hated and despised Samaritan to minister to one of their own countrymen.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 380}
