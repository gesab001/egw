{"word": "\"The husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.\" James 5:7. So the Christian is to wait with patience for the fruition in his life of the word of God. Often when we pray for the graces of the Spirit, God works to answer our prayers by placing us in circumstances to develop these fruits; but we do not understand His purpose, and wonder, and are dismayed. Yet none can develop these graces except through the process of growth and fruit bearing. Our part is to receive God's word and to hold it fast, yielding ourselves fully to its control, and its purpose in us will be accomplished.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 61}
