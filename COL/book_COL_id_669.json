{"word": "Thus we are to serve God. He only serves who acts up to the highest standard of obedience. All who would be sons and daughters of God must prove themselves co-workers with God and Christ and the heavenly angels. This is the test for every soul. Of those who faithfully serve Him the Lord says, \"They shall be Mine, . . . in that day when I make up My jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.\" Malachi 3:17.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 283}
