{"word": "Too often when wrongs are committed again and again, and the wrongdoer confesses his fault, the injured one becomes weary, and thinks he has forgiven quite enough. But the Saviour has plainly told us how to deal with the erring: \"If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.\" Luke 17:3. Do not hold him off as unworthy of your confidence. Consider \"thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\" Galatians 6:1.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 249}
