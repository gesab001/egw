{"word": "This robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has in it not one thread of human devising. Christ in His humanity wrought out a perfect character, and this character He offers to impart to us. \"All our righteousness are as filthy rags.\" Isaiah 64:6. Everything that we of ourselves can do is defiled by sin. But the Son of God \"was manifested to take away our sins; and in Him is no sin.\" Sin is defined to be \"the transgression of the law.\" 1 John 3:5, 4. But \n                                                                           312\nChrist was obedient to every requirement of the law. He said of Himself, \"I delight to do Thy will, O My God; yea, Thy law is within My heart.\" Psalm 40:8. When on earth, He said to His disciples, \"I have kept My Father's commandments.\" John 15:10. By His perfect obedience He has made it possible for every human being to obey God's commandments. When we submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united with His heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind becomes one with His mind, the thoughts are brought into captivity to Him; we live His life. This is what it means to be clothed with the garment of His righteousness. Then as the Lord looks upon us He sees, not the fig-leaf garment, not the nakedness and deformity of sin, but His own robe of righteousness, which is perfect obedience to the law of Jehovah.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 311}
