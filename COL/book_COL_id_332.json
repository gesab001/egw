{"word": "Peter's fall was not instantaneous, but gradual. Self-confidence led him to the belief that he was saved, and step after step was taken in the downward path, until he could deny his Master. Never can we safely put confidence in self or feel, this side of heaven, that we are secure against temptation. Those who accept the Saviour, however sincere their conversion, should never be taught to say or to feel that they are saved. This is misleading. Every one should be taught to cherish hope and faith; but even when we give ourselves to Christ and know that He accepts us, we are not beyond the reach of temptation. God's word declares, \"Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried.\" Daniel 12:10. Only he who endures the trial will receive the crown of life. (James 1:12.)", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 155}
