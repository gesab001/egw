{"word": "All this the teachers of Israel might have learned from the sacred scrolls of which it was their pride to be the keepers and expounders. Had not David written--David, who had fallen into deadly sin--\"I have gone astray like a lost sheep, seek Thy servant\"? Psalm 119:176. Had not Micah revealed God's love to the sinner, saying, \"Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He retaineth not His anger forever, because He delighteth in mercy\"? Micah 7:18.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 186}
