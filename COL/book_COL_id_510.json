{"word": "In choosing the guests for his feast, the Pharisee had consulted his own selfish interest. Christ said to him, \"When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors, lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 220}
