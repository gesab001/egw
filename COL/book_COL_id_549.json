{"word": "In these suffering ones we are to see those whom Christ came to save. His invitation to them is \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. . . . Hearken diligently unto Me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto Me: hear, and your soul shall live.\" Isaiah 55:1-3.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 233}
