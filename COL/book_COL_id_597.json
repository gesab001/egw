{"word": "This man has lived and planned for self. He sees that the future is abundantly provided for; there is nothing for him now but to treasure and enjoy the fruits of his labors. He regards himself as favored above other men, and takes credit to himself for his wise management. He is honored by his fellow townsmen as a man of good judgment and a prosperous citizen. For \"men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.\" Psalm 49:18.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 258}
