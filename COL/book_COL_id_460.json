{"word": "The love of God still yearns over the one who has chosen to separate from Him, and He sets in operation influences to bring him back to the Father's house. The prodigal son in his wretchedness \"came to himself.\" The deceptive power that Satan had exercised over him was broken. He saw that his suffering was the result of his own folly, and he said, \"How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father.\" Miserable as he was, the prodigal found hope in the conviction of his father's love. It was that love which was drawing him toward home. So it is the assurance of God's love that constrains the sinner to return to God. \"The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.\" Romans 2:4. A golden chain, the mercy and compassion of divine love, is passed around every imperiled soul. The Lord declares, \"I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.\" Jeremiah 31:3.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 202}
