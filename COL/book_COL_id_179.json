{"word": "\"Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\" Romans 10:17. The Scriptures are the great agency in the transformation of character. Christ prayed, \"Sanctify them through Thy truth; Thy word is truth.\" John 17:17. If studied and obeyed, the word of God works in the heart, subduing every unholy attribute. The Holy Spirit comes to convict of sin, and the faith that springs up in the heart works by love to Christ, conforming us in body, soul, and spirit to His own image. Then God can use us to do His will. The power given us works from within outwardly, leading us to communicate to others the truth that has been communicated to us.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 100}
