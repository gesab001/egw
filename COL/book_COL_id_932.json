{"word": "Chap. 26 - \"Friends by the Mammon of Unrighteousness\"\n\n     Christ's coming was at a time of intense worldliness. Men were subordinating the eternal to the temporal, the claims of the future to the affairs of the present. They were mistaking phantoms for realities, and realities for phantoms. They did not by faith behold the unseen world. Satan presented before them the things of this life as all-attractive and all-absorbing, and they gave heed to his temptations.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 366}
