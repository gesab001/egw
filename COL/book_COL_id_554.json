{"word": "The command given in the parable, to \"compel them to come in,\" has often been misinterpreted. It has been regarded as teaching that we should force men to receive the gospel. But it denotes rather the urgency of the invitation, and the effectiveness of the inducements presented. The gospel never employs force in bringing men to Christ. Its message is \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.\" Isaiah 55:1. \"The Spirit and the bride say, Come. . . . And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\" Revelation 22:17. The power of God's love and grace constrains us to come.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 235}
