{"word": "One of Christ's last commands to His disciples was \"Love one another as I have loved you.\" John 13:34. Do we obey this command, or are we indulging sharp, unchristlike traits of character? If we have in any way grieved or wounded others, it is our duty to confess our fault and seek for reconciliation. This is an essential preparation that we may come before God in faith, to ask His blessing.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 144}
