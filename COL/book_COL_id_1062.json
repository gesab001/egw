{"word": "The coming of the bridegroom was at midnight--the darkest hour. So the coming of Christ will take place in the darkest period of this earth's history. The days of Noah and Lot pictured the condition of the world just before the coming of the Son of man. The Scriptures pointing forward to this time declare that Satan will work with all power and \"with all deceivableness of unrighteousness.\" 2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10. His working is plainly revealed by the rapidly increasing darkness, the multitudinous errors, heresies, and delusions of these last days. Not only is Satan leading the world captive, but his deceptions are leavening the professed churches of our Lord Jesus Christ. The great apostasy will develop into darkness deep as midnight, impenetrable as sackcloth of hair. To God's people it will \n                                                                           415\nbe a night of trial, a night of weeping, a night of persecution for the truth's sake. But out of that night of darkness God's light will shine.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 414}
