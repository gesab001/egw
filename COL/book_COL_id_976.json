{"word": "Many today are making a similar mistake. They separate their duties into two distinct classes. The one class is made up of great things, to be regulated by the law of God; the other class is made up of so-called little things, in which the command, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,\" is ignored. This sphere of work is left to caprice, subject to inclination or impulse. Thus the character is marred, and the religion of Christ misrepresented.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 382}
