{"word": "The good-ground hearer receives the word \"not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God.\" 1 Thessalonians 2:13. Only he who receives the Scriptures as the voice of God speaking to himself is a true learner. He trembles at the word; for to him it is a living reality. He opens his understanding and his heart to receive it. Such hearers were Cornelius and his friends, who said to the apostle Peter, \"Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.\" Acts 10:33.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 59}
