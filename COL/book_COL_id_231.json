{"word": "The gospel of Christ is a blessing that all may possess. The poorest are as well able as the richest to purchase salvation; for no amount of worldly wealth can secure it. It is obtained by willing obedience, by giving ourselves to Christ as His own purchased possession. Education, even of the highest class, cannot of itself bring a man nearer to God. The Pharisees were favored with every temporal and every spiritual advantage, and they said with boastful pride, We are \"rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing\"; yet they were \"wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\" Revelation 3:17. Christ offered them the pearl of great price; but they disdained to accept it, and He said to them, \"The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.\" Matthew 21:31.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 117}
