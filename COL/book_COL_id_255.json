{"word": "In every age there is a new development of truth, a message of God to the people of that generation. The old truths are all essential; new truth is not independent of the old, but an unfolding of it. It is only as the old truths are understood that we can comprehend the new. When Christ desired to open to His disciples the truth of His resurrection, He began \"at Moses and all the prophets\" \n                                                                           128\nand \"expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself.\" Luke 24:27. But it is the light which shines in the fresh unfolding of truth that glorifies the old. He who rejects or neglects the new does not really possess the old. For him it loses its vital power and becomes but a lifeless form.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 127}
