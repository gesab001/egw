{"word": "Those who accept Christ, and in their first confidence say, I am saved, are in danger of trusting to themselves. They lose sight of their own weakness and their constant need of divine strength. They are unprepared for Satan's devices, and under temptation many, like Peter, fall into the very depths of sin. We are admonished, \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" 1 Corinthians 10:12. Our only safety is in constant distrust of self, and dependence on Christ.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 155}
