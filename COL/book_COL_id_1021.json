{"word": "In the parable the first laborers agreed to work for a stipulated sum, and they received the amount specified, nothing more. Those later hired believed the master's promise, \"Whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.\" They showed their confidence in him by asking no question in regard to wages. They trusted to his justice and equity. They were rewarded, not according to the amount of their labor, but according to the generosity of his purpose.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 397}
