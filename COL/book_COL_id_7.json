{"word": "In the sermon on the mount these words were spoken to others besides children and youth. They were spoken to the multitude, among whom were men and women full of worries and perplexities, and sore with disappointment and sorrow. Jesus continued: \"Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (for after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\" Then spreading out His hands to the surrounding multitude, He said, \"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" Matthew 6:28-33.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 19}
