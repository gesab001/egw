{"word": "\"We can not tell.\" This answer was a falsehood. But the priests saw the position they were in, and falsified in order to screen themselves. John the Baptist had come bearing witness of the One whose authority they were now questioning. He had pointed Him out, saying, \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" John 1:29.
