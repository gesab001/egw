{"word": "Little did the gay, thoughtless youth, as he went out from his father's gate, dream of the ache and longing left in that father's heart. When he danced and feasted with his wild companions, little did he think of the shadow that had fallen on his home. And now as with weary and painful steps he pursues the homeward way, he knows not that one is watching for his return. But while he is yet \"a great way off\" the father discerns his form. Love is of quick sight. Not even the degradation of the years of sin can conceal the son from the father's eyes. He \"had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck\" in a long, clinging, tender embrace.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 203}
