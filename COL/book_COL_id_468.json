{"word": "What assurance here, of God's willingness to receive the repenting sinner! Have you, reader, chosen your own way? Have you wandered far from God? Have you sought to feast upon the fruits of transgression, only to find them turn to ashes upon your lips? And now, your substance spent, your life-plans thwarted, and your hopes dead, do you sit alone and desolate? Now that voice which has long been speaking to your heart but to which you would not listen comes to you distinct and clear, \"Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest; because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.\" Micah 2:10. Return to your Father's house. He invites you, saying, \"Return unto Me; for I have redeemed thee.\" Isaiah 44:22.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 205}
