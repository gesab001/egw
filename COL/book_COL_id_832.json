{"word": "The right culture and use of the power of speech has to do with every line of Christian work; it enters into the home life, and into all our intercourse with one another. We should accustom ourselves to speak in pleasant tones, to use pure and correct language, and words that are kind and courteous. Sweet, kind words are as dew and gentle showers to the soul. The Scripture says of Christ that grace was poured into His lips that He might \"know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.\" Psalm 45:2; Isaiah 50:4. And the Lord bids us, \"Let your speech be alway with grace\" (Colossians 4:6) \"that it may minister grace unto the hearers\" (Ephesians 4:29). \n                                                                           337", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 336}
