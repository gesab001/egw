{"word": "For each of the classes represented by the Pharisee and the publican there is a lesson in the history of the apostle Peter. In his early discipleship Peter thought himself strong. Like the Pharisee, in his own estimation he was \"not as other men are.\" When Christ on the eve of His betrayal forewarned His disciples, \"All ye shall be offended because of Me this night,\" Peter confidently declared, \"Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.\" Mark 14:27, 29. Peter did not know his own danger. Self-confidence misled him. He thought himself able to withstand temptation; but in a few short hours the test came, and with cursing and swearing he denied his Lord.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 152}
