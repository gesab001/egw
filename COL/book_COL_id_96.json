{"word": "\"And bring forth fruit.\" Those who, having heard the word, keep it, will bring forth fruit in obedience. The word of God, received into the soul, will be manifest in good works. Its results will be seen in a Christlike character and life. Christ said of Himself, \"I delight to do Thy will, O My God; yea, Thy law is within My heart.\" Psalm 40:8. \"I seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent Me.\" John 5:30. And the Scripture says, \"He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\" 1 John 2:6.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 60}
