{"word": "God is love. He has shown that love in the gift of Christ. When \"He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life,\" He withheld nothing from His purchased possession. (John 3:16.) He gave all heaven, from which we may draw strength and efficiency, that we be not repulsed or overcome by our great adversary. But the love of God does not lead Him to excuse sin. He did not excuse it in Satan; He did not excuse it in Adam or in Cain; nor will He excuse it in any other of the children of men. He will not connive at our sins or overlook our defects of character. He expects us to overcome in His name.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 316}
