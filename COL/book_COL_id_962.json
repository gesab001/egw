{"word": "The parable of the good Samaritan was called forth by a question put to Christ by a doctor of the law. As the Saviour was teaching, \"a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\" The Pharisees had suggested this question to the lawyer in the hope that they might entrap Christ in His words, and they listened eagerly for His answer. But the Saviour entered into no controversy. He required the answer from the questioner himself. \"What is written in the law?\" He asked, \"How readest thou?\" The Jews still accused Jesus of lightly regarding the law given from Sinai, but He turned the question of salvation upon the keeping of God's commandments.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 377}
