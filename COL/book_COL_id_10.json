{"word": "In the earlier part of His ministry, Christ had spoken to the people in words so plain that all His hearers might have grasped truths which would make them wise unto salvation. But in many hearts the truth had taken no root, and it had been quickly caught away. \"Therefore speak I to them in parables.\" He said; \"because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. . . . For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed.\" Matthew 13:13-15.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 20}
