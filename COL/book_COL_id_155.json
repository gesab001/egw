{"word": "As the seed sown produces a harvest, and this in turn is sown, the harvest is multiplied. In our relation to others, this law holds true. Every act, every word, is a seed that will bear fruit. Every deed of thoughtful kindness, of obedience, or of self-denial, will reproduce itself in others, and through them in still others. So every act of envy, malice, or dissension is a seed that will spring up in a \"root of bitterness\" (Hebrews 12:15), whereby many shall be defiled. And how much larger number will the \"many\" poison. Thus the sowing of good and evil goes on for time and for eternity. \n\n                                               -", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 85}
