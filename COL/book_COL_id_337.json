{"word": "Christ offered up His broken body to purchase back God's heritage, to give man another trial. \"Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.\" Hebrews 7:25. By His spotless life, His obedience, His death on the cross of Calvary, Christ interceded for the lost race. And now, not as a mere petitioner does the Captain of our salvation intercede for us, but as a Conqueror claiming His victory. His offering is complete, and as our Intercessor He executes His self-appointed work, holding before God the censer containing His own spotless merits and the prayers, confessions, and thanksgiving of His people. Perfumed with the fragrance of His righteousness, these ascend to God as a sweet savor. The offering is wholly acceptable, and pardon covers all transgression. \n                                                                           157", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 156}
