{"word": "Chap. 9 - The Pearl\n\n     The blessings of redeeming love our Savior compared to a precious pearl. He illustrated His lesson by the parable of the merchantman seeking goodly pearls \"who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\" Christ Himself is the pearl of great price. In Him is gathered all the glory of the Father, the fullness of the Godhead. He is the brightness of the Father's glory and the express image of His person. The glory of the attributes of God is expressed in His character. Every page of the Holy Scriptures shines with His light. The righteousness of Christ, as a pure, white pearl, has no defect, no stain. No work of man can improve the great and precious gift of God. It is without a flaw. In Christ are \"hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\" Colossians 2:3. He is \"made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.\" 1 Corinthians 1:30. All that can satisfy the needs and longings of the human soul, for this world and for the world to come, is found in Christ. Our Redeemer is the pearl so precious that in comparison all things else may be accounted loss. \n                                                                           116", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 115}
