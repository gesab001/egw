{"word": "But \"the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.\" 1 Corinthians 3:19. While the rich man is looking forward to years of enjoyment, the Lord is making far different plans. The message comes to this unfaithful steward, \"Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee.\" Here is a demand that money cannot supply. The wealth he has treasured can purchase no reprieve. In one moment that which he has toiled through his whole life to secure becomes worthless to him. \"Then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?\" His broad fields and well-filled granaries pass from under his control. \"He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.\" Psalm 39:6.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 258}
