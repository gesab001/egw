Standing afar off, he \"would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast,\" in bitter anguish and self-abhorrence. He felt that he had transgressed against God, that he was sinful and polluted. He could not expect even pity from those around him, for they looked upon him with contempt. He knew that he had no merit to commend him to God, and in utter self-despair he cried, \"God be merciful to me, a sinner.\" He did not compare himself with others. \n                                                                           152\nOverwhelmed with a sense of guilt, he stood as if alone in God's presence.
