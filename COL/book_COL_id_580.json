{"word": "When one turns away from human imperfections to behold Jesus, a divine transformation takes place in the character. The Spirit of Christ working upon the heart conforms it to His image. Then let it be your effort to lift up Jesus. Let the mind's eye be directed to \"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\" John 1:29. And as you engage in this work, remember that \"he \n                                                                           251\nwhich converteth the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.\" James 5:20.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 250}
