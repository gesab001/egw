{"word": "God had made the rich man a steward of His means, and it was his duty to attend to just such cases as that of the beggar. The command had been given, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might\" (Deuteronomy 6:5); and \"thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\" (Leviticus 19:18).

But he forgot that he was accountable for the use of his entrusted means and capabilities. The Lord's blessings rested upon him abundantly, but he employed them selfishly, to honor himself, not his Maker. In proportion to his abundance was his obligation to use his gifts for the uplifting of humanity. This was the Lord's command, but the rich man had no thought of his obligation to God. He lent money, and took interest for what he loaned; but he returned no interest for what God had lent him. He had knowledge and talents, but did not improve them. Forgetful of his accountability to God, he devoted all his powers to pleasure. Everything with which he was surrounded, his round of amusements, the praise and flattery of his friends, ministered to his selfish enjoyment. So engrossed was he in the society of his friends that he lost all sense of his responsibility to co-operate with God in His ministry of mercy. He had opportunity to understand the word of God, and to practice its teachings; but the pleasure-loving society he chose so occupied his time that he forgot the God of eternity.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 261}
