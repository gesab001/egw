{"word": "Gifts of the Holy Spirit \n\n     The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent especially the gifts and blessings imparted by the Holy Spirit. \"To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.\" 1 Corinthians 12:8-11. All men do not receive the same gifts, but to every servant of the Master some gift of the Spirit is promised.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 327}
