{"word": "Christ taught His disciples to pray \"Give us this day our daily bread.\" And pointing to the flowers He gave them the assurance, \"If God so clothe the grass of the field, . . . shall He not much more clothe you?\" Matthew 6:11, 30. Christ is constantly working to answer this prayer, and to make good this assurance. There is an invisible power constantly at work as man's servant to feed and to clothe him. Many agencies our Lord employs to make the seed, apparently thrown away, a living plant. And He supplies in due proportion all that is required to perfect the harvest. In the beautiful words of the psalmist: \n\n\n     \"Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it; \n      Thou greatly enrichest it; \n      The river of God is full of water; \n      Thou providest them corn when Thou hast so prepared \n          the earth. \n      Thou waterest her furrows abundantly; \n      Thou settlest the ridges thereof; \n      Thou makest it soft with showers; \n      Thou blessest the springing thereof. \n      Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness; \n      And Thy paths drop fatness.\" \n                                    Psalm 65:9-11, R.V. \n\n                                               -", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 81}
