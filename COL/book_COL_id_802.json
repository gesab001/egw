{"word": "To every man God has given \"according to his several ability.\" The talents are not apportioned capriciously. He who has ability to use five talents receives five. He who can improve but two, receives two. He who can wisely use only one, receives one. None need lament that they have not received larger gifts; for He who has apportioned to every man is equally honored by the improvement of each trust, whether it be great or small. The one to whom five talents have been committed is to render the improvement of five; he who has but one, the improvement of one. God expects returns \"according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.\" 2 Corinthians 8:12. \n                                                                           329", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 328}
