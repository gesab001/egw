{"word": "\"Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel: and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. And I said, Let them set a fair miter upon his head. So they set a fair miter upon his head, and clothed him with garments.\" Then with the authority of the Lord of hosts the angel made a solemn pledge to Joshua, the representative of God's people: \"If thou wilt walk in My ways, and if thou wilt keep My charge, then thou shalt also judge My house, and shalt also keep My courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by\"--even among the angels that surround the throne of God. (Zechariah 3:3-7.)", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 169}
