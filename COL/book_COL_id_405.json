{"word": "From garrets, from hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds, from mountains and deserts, from the caves of the earth and the caverns of the sea, Christ will gather His children to Himself. On earth they have been destitute, afflicted, and tormented. Millions have gone down to the grave loaded with infamy because they refused to yield to the deceptive claims of Satan. By human tribunals the children of God have been adjudged the vilest criminals. But the day is near when \"God is judge Himself.\" (Psalm 50:6). Then the decisions of earth shall be reversed. \"The \n                                                                           180\nrebuke of His people shall He take away.\" Isaiah 25:8. White robes will be given to every one of them. (Revelation 6:11.) And \"they shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord.\" Isaiah 62:12.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 179}
