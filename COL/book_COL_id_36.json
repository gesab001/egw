{"word": "The teachers of Israel were not sowing the seed of the word of God. Christ's work as a teacher of truth was in marked contrast to that of the rabbis of His time. They dwelt upon traditions, upon human theories and speculations. Often that which man had taught and written about \n                                                                           39\nthe word, they put in place of the word itself. Their teaching had no power to quicken the soul. The subject of Christ's teaching and preaching was the word of God. He met questioners with a plain, \"It is written.\" \"What saith the Scriptures?\" \"How readest thou?\" At every opportunity, when an interest was awakened by either friend or foe, He sowed the seed of the word. He who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Himself the living Word, points to the Scriptures, saying, \"They are they which testify of Me.\" And \"beginning at Moses and all the prophets,\" He opened to His disciples \"in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.\" John 5:39; Luke 24:27.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 38}
