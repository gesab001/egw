{"word": "When the king came in to view the guests, the real character of all was revealed. For every guest at the feast there had been provided a wedding garment. This garment was a gift from the king. By wearing it the guests showed their respect for the giver of the feast. But one man was clothed in his common citizen dress. He had refused to make the preparation required by the king. The garment provided for him at great cost he disdained to wear. Thus he insulted his lord. To the king's demand, \"How camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?\" he could answer nothing. He was self-condemned. Then the king said, \"Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness.\" \n                                                                           310", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 309}
