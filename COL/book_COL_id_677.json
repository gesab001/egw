{"word": "It was the privilege of the Jewish nation to represent the character of God as it had been revealed to Moses. In answer to the prayer of Moses, \"Show me Thy glory,\" the Lord promised, \"I will make all My goodness pass before thee.\" Exodus 33:18, 19. \"And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, \n                                                                           286\nmerciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.\" Exodus 34:6, 7. This was the fruit that God desired from His people. In the purity of their characters, in the holiness of their lives, in their mercy and loving-kindness and compassion, they were to show that \"the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.\" Psalm 19:7.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 285}
