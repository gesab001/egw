{"word": "The gradual development of the plant from the seed is an object lesson in child training. There is \"first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\" He who \n                                                                           83\ngave this parable created the tiny seed, gave it its vital properties, and ordained the laws that govern its growth. And the truths which the parable teaches were made a living reality in His own life. In both His physical and His spiritual nature He followed the divine order of growth illustrated by the plant, as He wishes all youth to do. Although He was the Majesty of heaven, the King of glory, He became a babe in Bethlehem, and for a time represented the helpless infant in its mother's care. In childhood He did the works of an obedient child. He spoke and acted with the wisdom of a child and not of a man, honoring His parents and carrying out their wishes in helpful ways, according to the ability of a child. But at each stage of His development He was perfect, with the simple, natural grace of a sinless life. The sacred record says of His childhood, \"The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.\" And of His youth it is recorded, \"Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\" Luke 2:40, 52.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 82}
