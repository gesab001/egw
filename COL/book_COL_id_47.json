{"word": "But the teacher of sacred truth can impart only that which he himself knows by experience. \"The sower sowed his seed.\" Christ taught the truth because He was the truth. His own thought, His character, His life-experience, were embodied in His teaching. So with His servants: those who would teach the word are to make it their own by a personal experience. They must know what it is to have Christ made unto them wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption. In presenting the word of God to others, they are not to make it a suppose-so or a may-be. They should declare with the apostle Peter, \"We have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of His majesty.\" 2 Peter 1:16. Every minister of Christ and every teacher should be able to say with the beloved John, \"The life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.\" 1 John 1:2.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 43}
