{"word": "There are conditions to the fulfillment of God's promises, and prayer can never take the place of duty. \"If ye love Me,\" Christ says, \"Keep My commandments.\" \"He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.\" John 14:15, 21. Those who bring their petitions to God, claiming His promise while they do not comply with the conditions, insult Jehovah. They bring the name of Christ as their authority for the fulfillment of the promise, but they do not those things that would show faith in Christ and love for Him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 143}
