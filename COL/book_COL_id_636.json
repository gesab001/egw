{"word": "In the sermon on the mount Christ said, \"Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.\" Matthew 7:21. The test of sincerity is not in words, but in deeds. Christ does not say to any man, What say ye more than others? but, \"What do ye more than others?\" Matthew 5:47. Full of meaning are His words, \"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.\" John 13:17. Words are of no value unless they are accompanied with appropriate deeds. This is the lesson taught in the parable of the two sons.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 272}
