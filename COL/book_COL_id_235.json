{"word": "The parable of the merchantman seeking goodly pearls has a double significance: it applies not only to men as seeking the kingdom of heaven, but to Christ as seeking His lost inheritance. Christ, the heavenly merchantman seeking goodly pearls, saw in lost humanity the pearl of price. In man, defiled and ruined by sin, He saw the possibilities of redemption. Hearts that have been the battleground of the conflict with Satan, and that have been rescued by the power of love, are more precious to the Redeemer than are those who have never fallen. God looked upon humanity, not as vile and worthless; He looked upon it in Christ, saw it as it might become through redeeming love. He collected all the riches of the universe, and laid them down in order to buy the pearl. And Jesus, having found it, resets it in His own diadem. \"For they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon His land.\" Zechariah 9:16. \"They shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels.\" Malachi 3:17.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 118}
