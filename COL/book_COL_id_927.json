{"word": "The Talent Removed \n\n     Upon the slothful servant the sentence was, \"Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.\" Here, as in the reward of the faithful worker, is indicated not merely the reward at the final judgment but the gradual process of retribution in this life. As in the natural, so in the spiritual world: every power unused will weaken and decay. Activity is the law of life; idleness is death. \"The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.\" 1 Corinthians 12:7. Employed to bless others, his gifts increase. Shut up to self-serving they diminish, and are finally withdrawn. He who refuses to impart that which he has received will at last find that he has nothing to give. He is consenting to a process that surely dwarfs and finally destroys the faculties of the soul.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 364}
