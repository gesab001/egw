{"word": "\"Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness,\" Christ says, \"that when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.\" R.V. God and Christ and angels are all ministering to the afflicted, the suffering, and the sinful. Give yourself to God for this work, use His gifts for this purpose, and you enter into partnership with heavenly beings. Your heart will throb in sympathy with theirs. You will be assimilated to them in character. To you these dwellers in the eternal tabernacles will not be strangers. When earthly things shall have passed away, the watchers at heaven's gates will bid you welcome.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 373}
