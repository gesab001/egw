{"word": "God stands toward His people in the relation of a father, and He has a father's claim to our faithful service. Consider the life of Christ. Standing at the head of humanity, serving His Father, He is an example of what every son should and may be. The obedience that Christ rendered God requires from human beings today. He served His Father with love, in willingness and freedom. \"I delight to do Thy will, O My God,\" He declared; \"yea, Thy law is within My heart.\" Psalm 40:8. Christ counted no sacrifice too great, no toil too hard, in order to accomplish the work which He came to do. At the age of twelve He said, \"Wist \n                                                                           283\nye not that I must be about My Father's business?\" Luke 2:49. He had heard the call, and had taken up the work. \"My meat,\" He said, \"is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to finish His work.\" John 4:34.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 282}
