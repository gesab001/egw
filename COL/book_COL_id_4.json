{"word": "In the days of Christ these lessons had been lost sight of. Men had well-nigh ceased to discern God in His works. The sinfulness of humanity had cast a pall over the fair face of creation; and instead of manifesting God, His works became a barrier that concealed Him. Men \"worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator.\" Thus the heathen \"became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\" Romans 1:25, 21. So in Israel, man's teaching had been put in the place of God's. Not only the things of nature, but the sacrificial service and the Scriptures themselves--all given to reveal God--were so perverted that they became the means of concealing Him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 18}
