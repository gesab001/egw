{"word": "\"If a man love Me,\" Christ said, \"he will keep My words; and My Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\" John 14:23. The spell of a stronger, a perfect mind will be over us; for we have a living connection with the source of all-enduring strength. In our divine life we shall be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. We shall no longer live the common life of selfishness, but Christ will live in us. His character will be reproduced in our nature. Thus shall we bring forth the fruits of the Holy Spirit--\"some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 61}
