{"word": "The shepherd who discovers that one of his sheep is missing does not look carelessly upon the flock that is safely housed, and say, \"I have ninety and nine, and it will cost me too much trouble to go in search of the straying one. \n                                                                           188\nLet him come back, and I will open the door of the sheepfold, and let him in.\" No; no sooner does the sheep go astray than the shepherd is filled with grief and anxiety. He counts and recounts the flock. When he is sure that one sheep is lost, he slumbers not. He leaves the ninety and nine within the fold, and goes in search of the straying sheep. The darker and more tempestuous the night and the more perilous the way, the greater is the shepherd's anxiety and the more earnest his search. He makes every effort to find that one lost sheep.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 187}
