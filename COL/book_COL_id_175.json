{"word": "The great truth of the conversion of the heart by the Holy Spirit is presented in Christ's words to Nicodemus: \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born from above, he can not see the kingdom of God. . . . That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth. So is every one that is born of the Spirit.\" John 3:3-8, margin.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 98}
