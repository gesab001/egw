{"word": "From the two olive trees the golden oil was emptied through the golden pipes into the bowl of the candlestick, and thence into the golden lamps that gave light to the sanctuary. So from the holy ones that stand in God's presence His Spirit is imparted to the human instrumentalities who are consecrated to His service. The mission of the two anointed ones is to communicate to God's people that heavenly grace which alone can make His word a lamp to the feet and a light to the path. \"Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Zechariah 4:6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 408}
