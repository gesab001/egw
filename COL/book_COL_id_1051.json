{"word": "In the parable, all the ten virgins went out to meet the bridegroom. All had lamps and vessels for oil. For a time there was seen no difference between them. So with the church that lives just before Christ's second coming. All have a knowledge of the Scriptures. All have heard the message of Christ's near approach, and confidently expect His appearing. But as in the parable, so it is now. A time of waiting intervenes, faith is tried; and when the cry is heard, \"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him,\" many are unready. They have no oil in their vessels with their lamps. They are destitute of the Holy Spirit.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 408}
