{"word": "There are those who profess to believe and to teach the truths of the Old Testament, while they reject the New. But in refusing to receive the teachings of Christ, they show that they do not believe that which patriarchs and prophets have spoken. \"Had ye believed Moses,\" Christ said, \"ye would have believed Me; for he wrote of Me.\" John 5:46. Hence there is no real power in their teaching of even the Old Testament.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 128}
