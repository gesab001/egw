{"word": "The good seed may for a time lie unnoticed in a cold, selfish, worldly heart, giving no evidence that it has taken root; but afterward, as the Spirit of God breathes on the soul, the hidden seed springs up, and at last bears fruit to the glory of God. In our lifework we know not which shall prosper, this or that. This is not a question for us to settle. We are to do our work, and leave the results with God. \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\" Ecclesiastes 11:6. God's great covenant declares that \"while the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest . . . shall not cease.\" Genesis 8:22. In the confidence of this promise the husbandman tills and sows. Not less confidently are we in the spiritual sowing to labor, trusting His assurance, \"So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth; it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\" Isaiah 55:11. \"He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\" Psalm 126:6.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 65}
