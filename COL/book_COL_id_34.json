{"word": "The word of God is the seed. Every seed has in itself a germinating principle. In it the life of the plant is enfolded. So there is life in God's word. Christ says, \"The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life.\" John 6:63. \"He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath everlasting life.\" John 5:24. In every command and in every promise of the word of God is the power, the very life of God, by which the command may be fulfilled and the promise realized. He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 38}
