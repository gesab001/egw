{"word": "Chap. 13 - Two Worshipers\n\n     \"Unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others,\" Christ spoke the parable of the Pharisee and the publican. The Pharisee goes up to the temple to worship, not because he feels that he is a sinner in need of pardon, but because he thinks himself righteous and hopes to win commendation. His worship he regards as an act of merit that will recommend him to God. At the same time it will give the people a high opinion of his piety. He hopes to secure favor with both God and man. His worship is prompted by self-interest.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 150}
