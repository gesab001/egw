To the church it is given \"that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white,\" \"not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.\" Revelation 19:8; Ephesians 5:27. The fine linen, says the Scripture, \"is the righteousness of saints.\" Revelation 19:8. It is the righteousness of Christ, His own unblemished character, that through faith is imparted to all who receive Him as their personal Saviour.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 310}
