{"word": "Among the Jews leaven was sometimes used as an emblem of sin. At the time of the Passover the people \n                                                                           96\nwere directed to remove all the leaven from their houses as they were to put away sin from their hearts. Christ warned His disciples, \"Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.\" Luke 12:1. And the apostle Paul speaks of the \"leaven of malice and wickedness.\" 1 Corinthians 5:8. But in the Saviour's parable, leaven is used to represent the kingdom of heaven. It illustrates the quickening, assimilating power of the grace of God.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 95}
