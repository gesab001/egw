{"word": "The widow's prayer, \"Avenge me\"--\"do me justice\" (R.V.)--\"of mine adversary,\" represents the prayer of God's children. Satan is their great adversary. He is the \"accuser of our brethren,\" who accuses them before God day and night. (Revelation 12:10.) He is continually working to misrepresent and accuse, to deceive and destroy the people of God. And it is for deliverance from the power of Satan and his agents that in this parable Christ teaches His disciples to pray.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 166}
