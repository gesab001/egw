{"word": "The Saviour does not point forward to a time when all the tares become wheat. The wheat and tares grow together until the harvest, the end of the world. Then the tares are bound in bundles to be burned, and the wheat is gathered into the garner of God. \"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.\" Then \"the Son of man shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 75}
