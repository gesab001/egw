{"word": "In His prayer to the Father, Christ gave to the world a lesson which should be graven on mind and soul. \"This is life eternal,\" He said, \"that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\" John 17:3. This is true education. It imparts power. The experimental knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent, transforms man into the image of God. It gives to man the mastery of himself, bringing every impulse and passion of the lower nature under the control of the higher powers of the mind. It makes its possessor a son of God and an heir of heaven. It brings him into communion with the mind of the Infinite, and opens to him the rich treasures of the universe.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 114}
