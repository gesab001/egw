{"word": "There is more hope for publicans and sinners than for those who know the word of God but refuse to obey it. He who sees himself a sinner with no cloak for his sin, who knows that he is corrupting soul, body, and spirit before God, becomes alarmed lest he be eternally separated from the kingdom of heaven. He realizes his diseased condition, and seeks healing from the great Physician who has said, \"Him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.\" John 6:37. These souls the Lord can use as workers in His vineyard.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 280}
