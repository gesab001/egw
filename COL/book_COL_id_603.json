{"word": "Chap. 21 - \"A Great Gulf Fixed\"\n\n     In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Christ shows that in this life men decide their eternal destiny. During probationary time the grace of God is offered to every soul. But if men waste their opportunities in self-pleasing, they cut themselves off from everlasting life. No afterprobation will be granted them. By their own choice they have fixed an impassable gulf between them and their God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 260}
