{"word": "As we near the close of this world's history, the prophecies relating to the last days especially demand our study. The last book of the New Testament scriptures is full of truth that we need to understand. Satan has blinded the minds of many, so that they have been glad of any excuse for not making the Revelation their study. But Christ through His servant John has here declared what shall be in the last days, and He says, \"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.\" Revelation 1:3.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 133}
