{"word": "We are living in a time when the last message of mercy, the last invitation, is sounding to the children of men. The command, \"Go out into the highways and hedges,\" is reaching its final fulfillment. To every soul Christ's invitation will be given. The messengers are saying, \"Come; for all things are now ready.\" Heavenly angels are still working in co-operation with human agencies. The Holy Spirit is presenting every inducement to constrain you to come. Christ is watching for some sign that will betoken the removing of the bolts and the opening of the door of your heart for His entrance. Angels are waiting to bear the tidings to heaven that another lost sinner has been found. The hosts of heaven are waiting, ready to strike their harps and to sing a song of rejoicing that another soul has accepted the invitation to the gospel feast.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 237}
