{"word": "Value of the Treasure \n\n     The Saviour saw that men were absorbed in getting gain, and were losing sight of eternal realities. He undertook to correct this evil. He sought to break the infatuating spell that was paralyzing the soul. Lifting up His voice He cried, \"What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\" Matthew 16:26. He presents before fallen humanity the nobler world they have lost sight of, that they may behold eternal realities. He takes them to the threshold of the Infinite, flushed with the indescribable glory of God, and shows them the treasure there. \n                                                                           107", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 106}
