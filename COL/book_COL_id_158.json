{"word": "By the casting of the grain into the soil, Christ represents the sacrifice of Himself for our redemption. \"Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die,\" He says, \"it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.\" John 12:24. So the death of Christ will result in fruit for the kingdom of God. In accordance with the law of the vegetable kingdom, life will be the result of His death.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 86}
