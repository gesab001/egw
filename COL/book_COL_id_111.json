Feeling our helplessness, we are to improve all the opportunities granted us to gain a fuller experience. As the plant takes root in the soil, so we are to take deep root in Christ. As the plant receives the sunshine, the dew, and the rain, we are to open our hearts to the Holy Spirit. The work is to be done \"not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Zechariah 4:6. If we keep our minds stayed upon Christ, He will come unto us \"as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\" Hosea 6:3. As the Sun of Righteousness, He will arise upon us \"with healing in His wings.\" Malachi 4:2. We shall \"grow as the lily.\" We shall \"revive as the corn, and grow as the vine.\" Hosea 14:5, 7.
