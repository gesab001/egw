{"word": "After relating the parable, Christ said, \"The children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.\" That is, worldly-wise men display more wisdom and earnestness in serving themselves than do the professed children of God in their service to Him. So it was in Christ's day. So it is now. Look at the life of many who claim to be Christians. The Lord has endowed them with capabilities, and power, and influence; He has entrusted them with money, that they may be co-workers with Him in the great redemption. All His gifts are to be used in blessing humanity, in relieving the suffering and the needy. We are to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to care for the widow and the fatherless, to minister to the distressed and downtrodden. God never meant that the widespread misery in the world should exist. He never meant that one man should have an abundance of the luxuries of life, while the children of others should cry for bread. The means over and above the actual necessities of life are entrusted to man to do good, to bless humanity. The Lord says, \"Sell that ye have, and give alms.\" Luke 12:33. Be \"ready to distribute, willing to communicate.\" 1 Timothy 6:18. \"When thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.\" Luke 14:13. \"Loose the bands of wickedness,\" \"undo the heavy burdens,\" \"let the oppressed go free,\" \n                                                                           371\n\"break every yoke.\" \"Deal thy bread to the hungry,\" \"bring the poor that are cast out to thy house.\" \"When thou seest the naked, . . . cover him.\" \"Satisfy the afflicted soul.\" Isaiah 58:6, 7, 10. \"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\" Mark 16:15. These are the Lord's commands. Are the great body of professed Christians doing this work?", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 370}
