{"word": "It is in a crisis that character is revealed. When the earnest voice proclaimed at midnight, \"Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him,\" and the sleeping virgins were roused from their slumbers, it was seen who had made preparation for the event. Both parties were taken unawares; but one was prepared for the emergency, and the other was found without preparation. So now, a sudden and unlooked-for calamity, something that brings the soul face to face with death, will show whether there is any real faith in the promises of God. It will show whether the soul is sustained by grace. The great final test comes at the close of human probation, when it will be too late for the soul's need to be supplied.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 412}
