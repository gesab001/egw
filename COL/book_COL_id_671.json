{"word": "There are only two classes in the world today, and only two classes will be recognized in the judgment--those who violate God's law and those who obey it. Christ gives the test by which to prove our loyalty or disloyalty. \"If ye love Me,\" He says, \"keep My commandments. . . . He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me. And he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him. . . . He that loveth Me not keepeth not My sayings; and the word which ye hear is not Mine, but the Father's which sent Me.\" \"If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.\" John 14:15-24; 15:10.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 283}
