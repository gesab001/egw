{"word": "Many who profess to be Christians neglect the claims of God, and yet they do not feel that in this there is any wrong. They know that the blasphemer, the murderer, the adulterer, deserves punishment; but as for them, they enjoy the services of religion. They love to hear the gospel preached, and therefore they think themselves Christians. Though they have spent their lives in caring for themselves, they will be as much surprised as was the unfaithful servant in the parable to hear the sentence, \"Take the talent from him.\" Like the Jews, they mistake the enjoyment of their blessings for the use they should make of them.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 365}
