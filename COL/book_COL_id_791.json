{"word": "Chap. 25 - Talents\n\n     Christ on the Mount of Olives had spoken to His disciples of His second advent to the world. He had specified certain signs that were to show when His coming was near, and had bidden His disciples watch and be ready. Again He repeated the warning, \"Watch therefore; for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.\" Then He showed what it means to watch for His coming. The time is to be spent, not in idle waiting, but in diligent working. This lesson He taught in the parable of the talents.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 325}
