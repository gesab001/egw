Risking his own life, he had treated the wounded man as his brother. This Samaritan represents Christ. Our Saviour \n                                                                           382\nmanifested for us a love that the love of man can never equal. When we were bruised and dying, He had pity upon us. He did not pass us by on the other side, and leave us, helpless and hopeless, to perish. He did not remain in His holy, happy home, where He was beloved by all the heavenly host. He beheld our sore need, He undertook our case, and identified His interests with those of humanity. He died to save His enemies. He prayed for His murderers. Pointing to His own example, He says to His followers, \"These things I command you, that ye love one another\"; \"as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\" John 15:17; 13:34.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 381}
