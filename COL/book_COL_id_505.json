{"word": "With what unwearied love did Christ minister to Israel during the period of added probation. Upon the cross He prayed, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\" Luke 23:24. After His ascension the gospel was preached first at Jerusalem. There the Holy Spirit was poured out. There the first gospel church revealed the power of the risen Saviour. There Stephen--\"his face as it had been the face of an angel\" (Acts 6:15)--bore his testimony and laid down his life. All that heaven itself could give was bestowed. \"What could have been done more to My vineyard,\" Christ said, \"that I have not done in it?\" Isaiah 5:4. So His care and labor for you are not lessened, but increased. Still He says, \"I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.\" Isaiah 27:3.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 218}
