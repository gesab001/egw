{"word": "The rabbis understood Christ's parable as applying to the publicans and sinners; but it has also a wider meaning. By the lost sheep Christ represents not only the individual sinner but the one world that has apostatized and has been ruined by sin. This world is but an atom in the vast dominions over which God presides, yet this little fallen world--the one lost sheep--is more precious in His sight than are the ninety and nine that went not astray from the fold. Christ, the loved Commander in the heavenly courts, \n                                                                           191\nstooped from His high estate, laid aside the glory that He had with the Father, in order to save the one lost world. For this He left the sinless worlds on high, the ninety and nine that loved Him, and came to this earth, to be \"wounded for our transgressions\" and \"bruised for our iniquities.\" (Isaiah 53:5.) God gave Himself in His Son that He might have the joy of receiving back the sheep that was lost.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 190}
