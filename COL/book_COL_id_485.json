{"word": "It is true that you claim to be a child of God; but if this claim be true, it is \"thy brother\" that was \"dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.\" He is bound to you by the closest ties; for God recognizes him as a son. Deny your relationship to him, and you show that you are but a hireling in the household, not a child in the family of God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 211}
