{"word": "But the Lord in His great mercy is ready to forgive, and He says, \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, \n                                                                           145\nthat there may be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, . . . if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field. . . . And all nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.\" Malachi 3:10-12.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 144}
