{"word": "The world is perishing for want of the gospel. There is a famine for the word of God. There are few who preach the word unmixed with human tradition. Though men have the Bible in their hands, they do not receive the blessing that God has placed in it for them. The Lord calls upon His servants to carry His message to the people. \n                                                                           229\nThe word of everlasting life must be given to those who are perishing in their sins.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 228}
