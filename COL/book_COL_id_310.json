This explains what is meant when it is said that the Spirit \"maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.\" Romans 8:26. Such prayer God delights to answer. When with earnestness and intensity we breathe a prayer in the name of Christ, there is in that very intensity a pledge from God that He is about to answer our prayer \"exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.\" Ephesians 3:20.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 147}
