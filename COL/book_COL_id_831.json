{"word": "Especially is this true of those who are called to public service. Every minister and every teacher should bear in mind that he is giving to the people a message that involves eternal interests. The truth spoken will judge them in the great day of final reckoning.

Slowly, distinctly, and solemnly should it be spoken, yet with all the earnestness which its importance demands.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 336}
