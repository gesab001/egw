As soon as the divine word comes to our hearts, God desires us to receive it; and it is right to accept it with joy. \"Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.\" Luke 15:7. And there is joy in the soul that believes on Christ. But those who in the parable are said to receive the word immediately, do not count the cost. They do not consider what the word of God requires of them. They do not bring it face to face with all their habits of life, and yield themselves fully to its control.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 46}
