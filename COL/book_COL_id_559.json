{"word": "Every time you refuse to listen to the message of mercy, you strengthen yourself in unbelief. Every time you fail to open the door of your heart to Christ, you become more and more unwilling to listen to the voice of Him that speaketh. You diminish your chance of responding to the last appeal of mercy. Let it not be written of you, as of ancient Israel, \"Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.\" Hosea 4:17. Let not Christ weep over you as He wept over Jerusalem, saying, \"How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.\" Luke 13:34, 35.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 237}
