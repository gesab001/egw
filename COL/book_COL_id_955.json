{"word": "Christ calls upon every one to consider. Make an honest reckoning. Put into one scale Jesus, which means eternal treasure, life, truth, heaven, and the joy of Christ in souls redeemed; put into the other every attraction the world can offer. Into one scale put the loss of your own soul, and the souls of those whom you might have been instrumental in saving; into the other, for yourself and for them, a life that measures with the life of God. Weigh for time and for eternity. While you are thus engaged, Christ speaks: \"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" Mark 8:36.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 374}
