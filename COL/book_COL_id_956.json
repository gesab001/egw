{"word": "God desires us to choose the heavenly in place of the earthly. He opens before us the possibilities of a heavenly investment. He would give encouragement to our loftiest aims, security to our choicest treasure. He declares, \"I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\" Isaiah 13:12. When the riches that moth devours and rust corrupts shall be swept away, Christ's followers can rejoice in their heavenly treasure, the riches that are imperishable.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 374}
