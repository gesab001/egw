{"word": "If we surrender our lives to His service, we can never be placed in a position for which God has not made provision. Whatever may be our situation, we have a Guide to direct our way; whatever our perplexities, we have a sure Counselor; whatever our sorrow, bereavement, or loneliness, we have a sympathizing Friend. If in our ignorance we make missteps, Christ does not leave us. His voice, clear and distinct, is heard saying, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\" John 14:6. \"He shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.\" Psalm 72:12.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 173}
