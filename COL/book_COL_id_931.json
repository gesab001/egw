{"word": "Many who excuse themselves from Christian effort plead their inability for the work. But did God make them so incapable? No, never. This inability has been produced by their own inactivity and perpetuated by their deliberate choice. Already, in their own characters, they are realizing the result of the sentence, \"Take the talent from him.\" The continual misuse of their talents will effectually quench for them the Holy Spirit, which is the only light. The sentence, \"Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness,\" sets Heaven's seal to the choice which they themselves have made for eternity.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 365}
