{"word": "If you have chosen such a life, you know that you are spending money for that which is not bread, and labor for that which satisfieth not. There come to you hours when you realize your degradation. Alone in the far country you feel your misery, and in despair you cry, \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\" Romans 7:24. It is the statement of a universal truth which is contained in the prophet's words, \"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord. For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.\" Jeremiah 17:5, 6. God \"maketh \n                                                                           202\nHis sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust\" (Matthew 5:45); but men have the power to shut themselves away from sunshine and shower. So while the Sun of Righteousness shines, and the showers of grace fall freely for all, we may by separating ourselves from God still \"inhabit the parched places in the wilderness.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 201}
