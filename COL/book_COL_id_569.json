{"word": "In the parable the lord summoned the unmerciful debtor, and \"said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me; shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.\" \"So likewise,\" said Jesus, \"shall My Heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\" He who refuses to forgive is thereby casting away his own hope of pardon.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 247}
