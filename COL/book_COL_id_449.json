{"word": "Chap. 16 - \"Lost, and is Found\"\n\n     The parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son, bring out in distinct lines God's pitying love for those who are straying from Him. Although they have turned away from God, He does not leave them in their misery. He is full of kindness and tender pity toward all who are exposed to the temptations of the artful foe.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 198}
