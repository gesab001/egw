He realized his folly, and thought of his brothers, who would go on as he had gone, living to please themselves. Then he made the request, \"I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him [Lazarus] to my father's house; for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.\" But \"Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "COL", "page": 264}
