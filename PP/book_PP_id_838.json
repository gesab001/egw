{"word": "Only a few days had passed since the Hebrews had made a solemn covenant with God to obey His voice. They had stood trembling with terror before the mount, listening to the words of the Lord, \"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.\" The glory of God still hovered above Sinai in the sight of the congregation; but they turned away, and asked for other gods. \"They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped the molten image. Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox.\" Psalm 106:19, 20. How could greater ingratitude have been shown, or more daring insult offered, to Him who had revealed Himself to them as a tender father and an all-powerful king!", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 317}
