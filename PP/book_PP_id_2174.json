{"word": "David's \"last words,\" as recorded, are a song--a song of trust, of loftiest principle, and undying faith: \n\n\n          \"David the son of Jesse saith, \n           And the man who was raised on high saith, \n           The anointed of the God of Jacob, \n           And the sweet psalmist of Israel: \n           The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me: . . . \n           One that ruleth over men righteously, \n           That ruleth in the fear of God, \n           He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, \n           A morning without clouds; \n           When the tender grass springeth out of the earth, \n           Through clear shining after rain. \n           Verily my house is not so with God; \n           Yet He hath made me an everlasting covenant, \n           Ordered in all things, and sure: \n           For it is all my salvation, and all my desire.\" \n                                                      2 Samuel 23:1-5, R.V.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 754}
