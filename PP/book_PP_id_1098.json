{"word": "In the name of the God of Israel, Moses now declared, in the hearing of the congregation: \"Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent me. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit, then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 400}
