{"word": "Again the people sought help from Him whom they had so forsaken and insulted. \"The children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, We have sinned against Thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.\" But sorrow had not worked true repentance. The people mourned because their sins had brought suffering upon themselves, but not because they had dishonored God by transgression of His holy law. True repentance is more than sorrow for sin. It is a resolute turning away from evil.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 557}
