At sight of this man David determined to make haste to secure another place of refuge, and to obtain some weapon with which to defend himself if defense should become necessary. He asked Ahimelech for a sword, and was told that he had none except the sword of Goliath, which had been kept as a relic in the tabernacle. David replied, \"There is none like that; give it me.\" His courage revived as he grasped the sword that he had once used in destroying the champion of the Philistines.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 656}
