He bade them also take to the ruler a present of such things as the famine-wasted country afforded--\"a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds,\" also a double quantity of money. \"Take also your brother,\" he said, \"and arise, go again unto the man.\" As his sons were about to depart on their doubtful journey the aged father arose, and raising his hands to heaven, uttered the prayer, \"God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 227}
