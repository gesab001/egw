{"word": "The most important part of the daily ministration was the service performed in behalf of individuals. The repentant sinner brought his offering to the door of the tabernacle, and, placing his hand upon the victim's head, confessed his sins, thus in figure transferring them from himself to the innocent sacrifice. By his own hand the animal was then slain, and the blood was carried by the priest into the holy place and sprinkled before the veil, behind which was the ark containing the law that the sinner had transgressed. By this ceremony the sin was, through the blood, transferred in figure to the sanctuary. In some cases the blood was not taken into the holy place; [SEE APPENDIX, NOTE 6.] but the flesh was then to be eaten by the priest, as Moses directed the sons of Aaron, saying, \"God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation.\" \n                                                                           355\nLeviticus 10:17. Both ceremonies alike symbolized the transfer of the sin from the penitent to the sanctuary.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 354}
