{"word": "When the woman was asked, \"What is this that thou hast done?\" she answered, \"The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\" \"Why didst Thou create the serpent? Why didst Thou suffer him to enter Eden?\"--these were the questions implied in her excuse for her sin. Thus, like Adam, she charged God with the responsibility of their fall. The spirit of self-justification originated in the father of lies; it was indulged by our first parents as soon as they yielded to the influence of Satan, and has been exhibited by all the sons and daughters of Adam. Instead of humbly confessing their sins, they try to shield themselves by casting the blame upon others, upon circumstances, or upon God--making even His blessings an occasion of murmuring against Him.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 58}
