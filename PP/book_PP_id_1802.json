{"word": "God's repentance is not like man's repentance. \"The Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for He is not a man, that He should repent.\" Man's repentance implies a change of mind. God's repentance implies a change of circumstances and relations. Man may change his relation to God by complying with the conditions upon which he may be brought into the divine favor, or he may, by his own action, place himself outside the favoring condition; but the Lord is the same \"yesterday, and today, and forever.\" Hebrews 13:8. Saul's disobedience changed his relation to God; but the conditions of acceptance with God were unaltered--God's requirements were still the same, for with Him there \"is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\" James 1:17.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 630}
