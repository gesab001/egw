{"word": "The same obligation rests upon every follower of Christ. The apostle Peter declares, \"Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people.\" 1 Peter 2:9. We are required by God to preserve every power in the best possible condition, that we may render acceptable service to our Creator. When intoxicants are used, the same effects will follow as in the case of those priests of Israel. The conscience will lose its sensibility to sin, and a process of hardening to iniquity will most certainly take place, till the common and the sacred will lose all difference of significance. How can we then meet the standard of the divine requirements?\" \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods.\" 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\" 1 Corinthians 10:31. To the church of Christ in all ages is addressed the solemn and fearful warning, \"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\" 1 Corinthians 3:17.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 362}
