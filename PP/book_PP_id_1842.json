{"word": "As David drew near to the army, he heard the sound of commotion, as if an engagement was about to begin. And \"the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.\" Israel and the Philistines were drawn up in array, army against army. David ran to the army, and came and saluted his brothers. While he was talking with them, Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, came forth, and with insulting language defied Israel and challenged them to provide a man from their ranks who would meet him in single combat. He repeated his challenge, and when David saw that all Israel were filled with fear, and learned that the Philistine's defiance was hurled at them day after day, without arousing a champion to silence the boaster, his spirit was stirred within him. He was fired with zeal to preserve the honor of the living God and the credit of His people.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 645}
