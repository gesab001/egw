{"word": "Chap. 39 - The Conquest of Bashan\n\n     After passing to the south of Edom, the Israelites turned northward, and again set their faces toward the Promised Land. Their route now lay over a vast, elevated plain, swept by cool, fresh breezes from the hills. It was a welcome change from the parched valley through which they had been traveling, and they pressed forward, buoyant and hopeful. Having crossed the brook Zered, they passed to the east of the land of Moab; for the command had been given, \"Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot.\" And the same direction was repeated concerning the Ammonites, who were also descendants of Lot.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 433}
