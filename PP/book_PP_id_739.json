{"word": "\"Whoso offereth praise,\" says the Creator, \"glorifieth Me.\" Psalm 50:23. All the inhabitants of heaven unite in praising God. Let us learn the song of the angels now, that we may sing it when we join their shining ranks. Let us say with the psalmist, \"While \n                                                                           290\nI live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.\" \"Let the people praise Thee, O God; let all the people praise Thee.\" Psalm 146:2; 67:5.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 289}
