{"word": "\"By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches \n                                                                           246\nthan the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.\" Hebrews 11:24-26. Moses was fitted to take pre-eminence among the great of the earth, to shine in the courts of its most glorious kingdom, and to sway the scepter of its power. His intellectual greatness distinguishes him above the great men of all ages. As historian, poet, philosopher, general of armies, and legislator, he stands without a peer. Yet with the world before him, he had the moral strength to refuse the flattering prospects of wealth and greatness and fame, \"choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 245}
