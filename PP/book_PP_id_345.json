{"word": "Chap. 14 - Destruction of Sodom\n\n     Fairest among the cities of the Jordan Valley was Sodom, set in a plain which was \"as the garden of the Lord\" in its fertility and beauty. Here the luxuriant vegetation of the tropics flourished. Here was the home of the palm tree, the olive, and the vine; and flowers shed their fragrance throughout the year. Rich harvests clothed the fields, and flocks and herds covered the encircling hills. Art and commerce contributed to enrich the proud city of the plain. The treasures of the East adorned her palaces, and the caravans of the desert brought their stores of precious things to supply her marts of trade. With little thought or labor, every want of life could be supplied, and the whole year seemed one round of festivity.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 156}
