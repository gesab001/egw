{"word": "On the morning of the third day, as the eyes of all the people were turned toward the mount, its summit was covered with a thick cloud, which grew more black and dense, sweeping downward until the entire mountain was wrapped in darkness and awful mystery. Then a sound as of a trumpet was heard, summoning the people to meet with God; and Moses led them forth to the base of the mountain. From the thick darkness flashed vivid lightnings, while peals of thunder echoed and re-echoed among the surrounding heights. \"And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.\" \"The glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount\" in the sight of the assembled multitude. And \"the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder.\" So terrible were the tokens of Jehovah's presence that the hosts of Israel shook with fear, and fell upon their faces before the Lord. Even Moses exclaimed, \"I exceedingly fear and quake.\" Hebrews 12:21.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 304}
