{"word": "Chap. 64 - David a Fugitive \n\n     After the slaying of Goliath, Saul kept David with him, and would not permit him to return to his father's house. And it came to pass that \"the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.\" Jonathan and David made a covenant to be united as brethren, and the king's son \"stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.\" David was entrusted with important responsibilities, yet he preserved his modesty, and won the affection of the people as well as the royal household.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 649}
