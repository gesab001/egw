{"word": "The first of these festivals, the Passover, the feast of unleavened bread, occurred in Abib, the first month of the Jewish year, corresponding to the last of March and the beginning of April. The cold of winter was past, the latter rain had ended, and all nature rejoiced in the freshness and beauty of the springtime. The grass was green on the hills and valleys, and wild flowers everywhere brightened the fields. The moon, now approaching the full, made the evenings delightful. It was the season so beautifully pictured by the sacred singer: \n                                                                           538\n\n          \"The winter is past, \n           The rain is over and gone; \n           The flowers appear on the earth; \n           The time of the singing of birds is come, \n           And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; \n           The fig tree ripeneth her green figs, \n           And the vines are in blossom, \n           They give forth their fragrance.\" Song of Solomon 2:11-13, R.V.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 537}
