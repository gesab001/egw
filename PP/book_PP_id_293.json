{"word": "At this time the rite of circumcision was given to Abraham as \"a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised.\" Romans 4:11. It was to be observed by the patriarch and his descendants as a token that they were devoted to the service of God and thus separated from idolaters, and that God accepted them as His peculiar treasure. By this rite they were pledged to fulfill, on their part, the conditions of the covenant made with Abraham. They were not to contract marriages with the heathen; for by so doing they would lose their reverence for God and His holy law; they would be tempted to engage in the sinful practices of other nations, and would be seduced into idolatry.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 138}
