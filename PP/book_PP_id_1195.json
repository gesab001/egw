{"word": "\"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,\" even so was the Son of man \"lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.\" John 3:14, 15. All who have ever lived upon the earth have felt the deadly sting of \"that old serpent, called the devil, and Satan.\" Revelation 12:9. The fatal effects of sin can be removed only by the provision that God has made. The Israelites saved their lives by looking upon the uplifted serpent. That look implied faith. They lived because they believed God's word, and trusted in the means provided for their recovery. So the sinner may look to Christ, and live. He receives pardon through faith in the atoning sacrifice. Unlike the inert and lifeless symbol, Christ has power and virtue in Himself to heal the repenting sinner.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 431}
