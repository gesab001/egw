{"word": "Like Israel, Christians too often yield to the influence of the world and conform to its principles and customs, in order to secure the friendship of the ungodly; but in the end it will be found that these professed friends are the most dangerous of foes. The Bible plainly teaches that there can be no harmony between the people of God and the world. \"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.\" 1 John 3:13. Our Saviour says, \"Ye know that it hated Me before it hated you.\" John 15:18. Satan works through the ungodly, under cover of a pretended friendship, to allure God's people into sin, that he may separate them from Him; and when their defense is removed, then he will lead his agents to turn against them and seek to accomplish their destruction.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 559}
