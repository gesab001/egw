{"word": "Moses now stretched forth his rod over the land, and an east wind blew, and brought locusts. \"Very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.\" They filled the sky till the land was darkened, and devoured every green thing remaining. Pharaoh sent for the prophets in haste, and said, \"I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you. Now therefore, forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the Lord your God, that He may take away from me this death only.\" They did so, and a strong west wind carried away the locusts toward the Red Sea. Still the king persisted in his stubborn resolution.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 271}
