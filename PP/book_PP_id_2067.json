{"word": "David's power had been given him by God, but to be exercised only in harmony with the divine law. When he commanded that which was contrary to God's law, it became sin to obey. \"The powers that be are ordained of God\" (Romans 13:1), but we are not to obey them contrary to God's law.

He says, \"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.\" 1 Corinthians 11:1.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 719}
