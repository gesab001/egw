{"word": "When Saul heard the words of David he was humbled, and could not but admit their truthfulness. His feelings were deeply moved as he realized how completely he had been in the power of the man whose life he sought. David stood before him in conscious innocence. With a softened spirit, Saul exclaimed, \"Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.\" Then he declared to David: \"Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. . . . For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day. And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.\" And David made a covenant with Saul that when this should take place he would favorably regard the house of Saul, and not cut off his name.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 662}
