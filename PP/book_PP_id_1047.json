{"word": "This manifestation of the Lord's displeasure was designed to be a warning to all Israel, to check the growing spirit of discontent and insubordination. If Miriam's envy and dissatisfaction had not been signally rebuked, it would have resulted in great evil. Envy is one of the most satanic traits that can exist in the human heart, and it is one of the most baleful in its effects. Says the wise man, \"Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?\" Proverbs 27:4. It was envy that first caused discord in heaven, and its indulgence has wrought untold evil among men. \"Where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.\" James 3:16.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 385}
