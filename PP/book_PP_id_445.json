{"word": "The apostle Peter admonishes the undershepherds: \"Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.\" 1 Peter 5:2, 3. Paul says, \"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy \n                                                                           192\nGhost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which He hath purchased with His own blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.\" Acts 20:28, 29.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 191}
