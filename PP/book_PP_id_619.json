{"word": "Moses remained at court until he was forty years of age. His thoughts often turned upon the abject condition of his people, and he visited his brethren in their servitude, and encouraged them with the assurance that God would work for their deliverance. Often, stung to resentment by the sight of injustice and oppression, he burned to avenge their wrongs. One day, while thus abroad, seeing an Egyptian smiting an Israelite, he sprang forward and slew the Egyptian. Except the Israelite, there had been no witness to the deed, and Moses immediately buried the body in the sand. He had now shown himself ready to maintain the cause of his people, and he hoped to see them rise to recover their liberty. \"He supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them; but they understood not.\" Acts 7:25. They were not yet prepared for freedom. On the following day Moses saw two Hebrews striving together, \n                                                                           247\none of them evidently at fault. Moses reproved the offender, who at once retaliated upon the reprover, denying his right to interfere, and basely accusing him of crime: \"Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?\" he said. \"Intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 246}
