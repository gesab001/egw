{"word": "An attachment for David on the part of Michal, Saul's youngest daughter, afforded the king another opportunity to plot against his rival. Michal's hand was offered the young man on condition that evidence should be given of the defeat and slaughter of a specified number of their national foes. \"Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines,\" but God shielded His servant. David returned a victor from the battle, to become the king's son-in-law. \"Michal Saul's daughter loved him,\" and the monarch, enraged, saw that his plots had resulted in the elevation of him whom he sought to destroy. He was still more assured that this was the man whom the Lord had said was better than he, and who should reign on the throne of Israel in his place. Throwing off all disguise, he issued a command to Jonathan and to the officers of the court to take the life of the one he hated.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 652}
