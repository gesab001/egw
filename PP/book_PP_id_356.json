{"word": "The angels revealed to Lot the object of their mission: \"We will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy \n                                                                           160\nit.\" The strangers whom Lot had endeavored to protect, now promised to protect him, and to save also all the members of his family who would flee with him from the wicked city. The mob had wearied themselves out and departed, and Lot went out to warn his children. He repeated the words of the angels, \"Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city.\" But he seemed to them as one that mocked. They laughed at what they called his superstitious fears. His daughters were influenced by their husbands. They were well enough off where they were. They could see no evidence of danger. Everything was just as it had been. They had great possessions, and they could not believe it possible that beautiful Sodom would be destroyed.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 159}
