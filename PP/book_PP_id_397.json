{"word": "He who has entered the marriage relation while unconverted, is by his conversion placed under stronger obligation to be faithful to his companion, however widely they may differ in regard to religious faith; yet the claims of God should be placed above every earthly relationship, even though trials and persecution may be the result. With the spirit of love and meekness, this fidelity may have an influence to win the unbelieving one. But the marriage of Christians with the ungodly is forbidden in the Bible. The Lord's direction is, \"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.\" 2 Corinthians 6:14, 17, 18.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 175}
