At this feast it was expected that both the young men would appear at the king's table; but David feared to be present, and it was arranged that \n                                                                           655\nhe should visit his brothers in Bethlehem. On his return he was to hide himself in a field not far from the banqueting hall, for three days absenting himself from the presence of the king; and Jonathan would note the effect upon Saul. If inquiry should be made as to the whereabouts of the son of Jesse, Jonathan was to say that he had gone home to attend the sacrifice offered by his father's household. If no angry demonstrations were made by the king, but he should answer, \"It is well,\" then it would be safe for David to return to the court. But if he should become enraged at his absence, it would decide the matter of David's flight.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 654}
