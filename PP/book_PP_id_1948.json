{"word": "On the plain of Shunem and the slopes of Mount Gilboa the armies of Israel and the hosts of the Philistines closed in mortal combat. Though the fearful scene in the cave of Endor had driven all hope from his heart, Saul fought with desperate valor for his throne and his kingdom. But it was in vain. \"The men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa.\" Three brave sons of the king died at his side. The archers pressed upon Saul. He had seen his soldiers falling around him and his princely sons cut down by the sword. Himself wounded, he could neither fight nor fly. Escape was impossible, and determined not to be taken alive by the Philistines, he bade his armor-bearer, \"Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith.\" When the man refused to lift his hand \n                                                                           682\nagainst the Lord's anointed, Saul took his own life by falling upon his sword.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 681}
