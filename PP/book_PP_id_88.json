{"word": "Many who teach that the law of God is not binding upon man, urge that it is impossible for him to obey its precepts. But if this were true, why did Adam suffer the penalty of transgression? The sin of our first parents brought guilt and sorrow upon the world, and had it not been for the goodness and mercy of God, would have plunged the race into hopeless despair. Let none deceive themselves. \"The wages of sin is death.\" Romans 6:23. The law of God can no more be transgressed with impunity now than when sentence was pronounced upon the father of mankind.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 61}
