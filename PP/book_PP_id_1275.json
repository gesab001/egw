{"word": "When Balaam was called to curse the Hebrews he could not, by all his enchantments, bring evil upon them; for the Lord had not \"beheld iniquity in Jacob,\" neither had He \"seen perverseness in Israel.\" Numbers 23:21, 23. But when through yielding to temptation they transgressed God's law, their defense departed from them. When the people of God are faithful to His commandments, \"there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel.\" Hence all the power and wily arts of Satan are exerted to seduce them into sin. If those who profess to be the depositaries of God's law become transgressors of its precepts, they separate themselves from God, and they will be unable to stand before their enemies.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 457}
