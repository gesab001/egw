{"word": "If the one tried for murder were proved guilty, no atonement or ransom could rescue him. \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.\" Genesis 9:6. \"Ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.\" \"Thou shalt take him from Mine altar, that he may die,\" was the command of God; \"the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\" Numbers 35:31, 33; Exodus 21:14. The safety and purity of the nation demanded that the sin of murder be severely punished. Human life, which God alone could give, must be sacredly guarded.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 516}
