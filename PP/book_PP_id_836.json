{"word": "Aaron feared for his own safety; and instead of nobly standing up for the honor of God, he yielded to the demands of the multitude. His first act was to direct that the golden earrings be collected from all the people and brought to him, hoping that pride would lead them to refuse such a sacrifice. But they willingly yielded up their ornaments; and from these he made a molten calf, in imitation of the gods of Egypt. The people proclaimed, \"These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\" And Aaron basely permitted this insult to Jehovah. He did more. Seeing with what satisfaction the golden god was received, he built an altar before it, and made proclamation, \"Tomorrow is a feast to the Lord.\" The announcement was heralded by trumpeters from company to company throughout the camp. \"And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play.\" Under the pretense of holding \"a feast to the Lord,\" they gave themselves up to gluttony and licentious reveling.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 317}
