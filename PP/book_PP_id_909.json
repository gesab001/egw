{"word": "When Moses came from the divine Presence in the mount, where he had received the tables of the testimony, guilty Israel could not endure the light that glorified his countenance. How much less can transgressors look upon the Son of God when He shall appear in the glory of His Father, surrounded by all the heavenly host, to execute judgment upon the transgressors of His law and the rejecters of His atonement. Those who have disregarded the law of God and trodden under foot the blood of Christ, \"the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men,\" shall hide themselves \"in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains,\" and \n                                                                           341\nthey shall say to the mountains and rocks, \"Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?\" Revelation 6:15-17. \"In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, . . . to the moles and to the bats; to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty, when He ariseth to shake terribly the earth.\" Isaiah 2:20, 21.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 340}
