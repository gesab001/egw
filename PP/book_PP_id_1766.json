They were not prepared to meet the enemy, and many were so terrified that they dared not come to the test of an encounter.

As the time for the encounter drew near, the number of desertions rapidly increased, and those who did not withdraw from the ranks were filled with foreboding and terror.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 617}
