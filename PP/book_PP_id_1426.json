{"word": "The tribes of northern Palestine, terrified at the success which had attended the armies of Israel, now entered into a league against them. At the head of this confederacy was Jabin, king of Hazor, a territory to the west of Lake Merom. \"And they went out, they and all their hosts with them.\" This army was much larger than any that the Israelites had before encountered in Canaan--\"much people, even as the sand that is upon the seashore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.\" Again a message of encouragement was given to Joshua: \"Be not afraid because of them: for tomorrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 510}
