And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?\" Today the challenge to Israel might be repeated.

The laws of the nations bear marks of the infirmities and passions of the unrenewed heart; but God's law bears the stamp of the divine.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 465}
