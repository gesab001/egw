{"word": "These men, having entered upon a wrong course, stubbornly set themselves against Caleb and Joshua, against Moses, and against God. Every advance step rendered them the more determined. They were resolved to discourage all effort to gain possession of Canaan. They distorted the truth in order to sustain their baleful influence. It \"is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof,\" they said. This was not only an evil report, but it was also a lying one. It was inconsistent with itself. The spies had declared the country to be fruitful and prosperous, and the people of giant stature, all of which would be impossible if the climate were so unhealthful that the land could be said to \"eat up the inhabitants.\" But when men yield their hearts to unbelief they place themselves under the control of Satan, and none can tell to what lengths he will lead them.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 389}
