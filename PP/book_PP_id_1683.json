Eager to be free from its presence, yet not daring to remove it, the Beth-shemites sent a message to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, inviting them to take it away. With great joy the men of this place welcomed the sacred chest. They knew that it was the pledge of divine favor to the obedient and faithful.

This man appointed his son Eleazar to take charge of it, and it remained there for many years.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 589}
