{"word": "Abraham could not explain the leadings of Providence; he had not realized his expectations; but he held fast the promise, \"I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.\" With earnest prayer he considered how to preserve the life of his people and his flocks, but he would not allow circumstances to shake his faith in God's word. To escape the famine he went down into Egypt. He did not forsake Canaan, or in his extremity turn back to the Chaldean land from which he came, where there was no scarcity of bread; but he sought a temporary refuge as near as possible to the Land of Promise, intending shortly to return where God had placed him.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 129}
