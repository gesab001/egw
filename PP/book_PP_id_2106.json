Absalom artfully turned every cause of dissatisfaction to his own advantage. Day by day this man of noble mien might be seen at the gate of the city, where a crowd of suppliants waited to present their wrongs for redress. \n                                                                           730\nAbsalom mingled with them and listened to their grievances, expressing sympathy with their sufferings and regret at the inefficiency of the government.
