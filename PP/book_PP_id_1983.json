{"word": "David seemed to be cut off from every human support. All that he held dear on earth had been swept from him. Saul had driven him from his country; the Philistines had driven him from the camp; the Amalekites had plundered his city; his wives and children had been made prisoners; and his own familiar friends had banded against him, and threatened him even with death. In this hour of utmost extremity David, instead of permitting his mind to dwell upon these painful circumstances, looked earnestly to God for help. He \"encouraged himself in the Lord.\" He reviewed his past eventful life. Wherein had the Lord ever forsaken him? His soul was refreshed in recalling the many evidences of God's favor. The followers of David, by their discontent and impatience, made their affliction doubly grievous; but the man of God, having even greater cause for grief, bore himself with fortitude. \"What time I am afraid, I will trust in Thee\" (Psalm 56:3), was the language of his heart. Though he himself \n                                                                           693\ncould not discern a way out of the difficulty, God could see it, and would teach him what to do.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 692}
