{"word": "The calm faith of their leader inspired the people with confidence in God. They trusted all to His omnipotent arm, and He did not fail them. Not mighty giants nor walled cities, armed hosts nor rocky fortresses, could stand before the Captain of the Lord's host. The Lord led the army; the Lord discomfited the enemy; the Lord conquered in behalf of Israel.

Thus was blotted from the earth that strange people who had given themselves up to iniquity and abominable idolatry.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 436}
