{"word": "In the gathering of the manna it was found that some obtained more and some less than the stipulated amount; but \"when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack.\" An explanation of this scripture, as well as a practical lesson from it, is given by the apostle Paul in his second epistle to the Corinthians. He says, \"I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality: as it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.\" 2 Corinthians 8:13-15.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 295}
