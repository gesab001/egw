{"word": "Having sprinkled the altar with the blood of the offerings, Moses \"took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people.\" Thus the conditions of the covenant were solemnly repeated, and all were at liberty to choose whether or not they would comply with them. They had at the first promised to obey the voice of God; but they had since heard His law proclaimed; and its principles had been particularized, that they might know how much this covenant involved. Again the people answered with one accord, \"All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient.\" \"When Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood, . . . and sprinkled both the book and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.\" Hebrews 9:19, 20.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 312}
