But he had learned that in order to prevail with the people, he must have help from God. He pleaded for a clearer revelation of God's will and for an assurance of His presence: \"See, Thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me.

Now therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me now Thy way, that I may know Thee, that I may find grace in Thy sight: and consider that this nation is Thy people.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 327}
