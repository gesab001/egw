{"word": "The Father wrought by His Son in the creation of all heavenly beings. \"By Him were all things created, . . . whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him.\" Colossians 1:16. Angels are God's ministers, radiant with the light ever flowing from His presence and speeding on rapid wing to execute His will. But the Son, the anointed of God, the \"express image of His person,\" \"the brightness of His glory,\" \"upholding all things by the word of His power,\" holds supremacy over them all. Hebrews 1:3. \"A glorious high throne from the beginning,\" was the place of His sanctuary (Jeremiah 17:12); \"a scepter of righteousness,\" the scepter of His kingdom. Hebrews 1:8. \"Honor and majesty are before Him: strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.\" Psalm 96:6. Mercy and truth go before His face.
