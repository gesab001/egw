{"word": "God Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided \"an help meet for him\"--a helper corresponding to him--one who was fitted to be his companion, and who could be one with him in love and sympathy. Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was not to control him as the head, nor to be trampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and protected by him. A part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, she was his second self, showing the close union and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this relation. \"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it.\" Ephesians 5:29. \"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 46}
