It was no light humiliation to those citizens of a \"royal city,\" \"all the men whereof were mighty,\" to be made hewers of wood and drawers of water throughout their generations.

Thus through all their generations their servile condition would testify to God's hatred of falsehood.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 507}
