{"word": "Saith the Lord: \"I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all My counsel, and would none of My reproof: . . . when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon Me, but I will not answer; they shall seek Me early, but they shall not find Me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: they would none of My counsel: they despised all My reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.\" \"But whoso hearkeneth unto Me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.\" Proverbs 1:24-31, 33.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 558}
