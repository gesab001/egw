{"word": "When he saw that his end was near, he summoned his kinsmen about him. Honored as he had been in the land of the Pharaohs, Egypt was to him but the place of his exile; his last act was to signify that his lot was cast with Israel. His last words were, \"God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which He sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\" And he took a solemn oath of the children of Israel that they would carry up his bones with them to the land of Canaan. \"So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.\" And through the centuries of toil which followed, the coffin, a reminder of the dying words of Joseph, testified to Israel that they were only sojourners in Egypt, and bade them keep their hopes fixed upon the Land of Promise, for the time of deliverance would surely come.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 240}
