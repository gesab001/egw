{"word": "The cities of refuge appointed for God's ancient people were a symbol of the refuge provided in Christ. The same merciful Saviour who appointed those temporal cities of refuge has by the shedding of His own blood provided for the transgressors of God's law a sure retreat, into which they may flee for safety from the second death. No power can take out of His hands the souls that go to Him for pardon. \"There is therefore now no \n                                                                           517\ncondemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.\" \"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us;\" that \"we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.\" Romans 8:1, 34; Hebrews 6:18.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 516}
