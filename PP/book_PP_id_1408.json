{"word": "In their far-off home--professedly beyond the limits of Palestine--their fellow countrymen, they said, had heard of the wonders which God had wrought for His people, and had sent them to make a league with Israel. The Hebrews had been specially warned against entering into any league with the idolaters of Canaan, and a doubt as to the truth of the strangers' words arose in the minds of the leaders. \"Peradventure ye dwell among us,\" they said. To this the ambassadors only replied, \"We are thy servants.\" But when Joshua directly demanded of them, \"Who are ye? and from whence come ye?\" they reiterated their former statement, and added, in proof of their sincerity, \"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is moldy: and these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 505}
