{"word": "Although Lot owed his prosperity to his connection with Abraham, he manifested no gratitude to his benefactor. Courtesy would have dictated that he yield the choice to Abraham, but instead of this he selfishly endeavored to grasp all its advantages. He \"lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, . . . even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.\" The most fertile region in all Palestine was the Jordan Valley, reminding the beholders of the lost Paradise and equaling the beauty and productiveness of the Nile-enriched plains they had so lately left. There were cities also, wealthy and beautiful, inviting to profitable traffic in their crowded marts. Dazzled with visions of worldly gain, Lot overlooked the moral and spiritual evils that would be encountered there. The inhabitants of the plain were \"sinners before the Lord exceedingly;\" but of this he was ignorant, or, knowing, gave it but little weight. He \"chose him all the plain of Jordan,\" and \"pitched his tent toward Sodom.\" How little did he foresee the terrible results of that selfish choice!", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 133}
