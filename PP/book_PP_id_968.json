{"word": "\"Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, . . . for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.\" The great leader reminded his brother of the words of God, \"I will be sanctified in them that come nigh Me, and before all the people I will be glorified.\" Aaron was silent. The death of his sons, cut down without warning, in so terrible a sin--a sin which he now saw to be the result of his own neglect of duty--wrung the father's heart with anguish, but he gave his feelings no expression. By no manifestation of grief must he seem to sympathize with sin. The congregation must not be led to murmur against God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 361}
