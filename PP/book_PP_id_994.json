{"word": "Like their Master, the followers of Christ in every age were to be the light of the world. The Saviour said, \"A city that is set on \n                                                                           370\nan hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house\"--that is, in the world. And He adds, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\" Matthew 5:14-16. This is just what Enoch, and Noah, Abraham, Joseph, and Moses did. It is just what God designed that His people Israel should do.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 369}
