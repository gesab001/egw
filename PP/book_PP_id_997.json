{"word": "This same covenant was renewed to Abraham in the promise, \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.\" Genesis 22:18. This promise pointed to Christ. So Abraham understood it (see Galatians 3:8, 16), and he trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sins. It was this faith that was accounted unto him for righteousness. The covenant with Abraham also maintained the authority of God's law. The Lord appeared unto Abraham, and said, \"I am the Almighty God; walk before Me, and be thou perfect.\" Genesis 17:1. The testimony of God concerning His faithful servant was, \"Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.\" Genesis 26:5. And the Lord declared to him, \"I will establish My covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.\" Genesis 17:7.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 370}
