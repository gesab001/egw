{"word": "Samuel was instructed to grant the request of the people, but to warn them of the Lord's disapproval, and also make known what would be the result of their course. \"And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king.\" He faithfully set before them the burdens that would be laid upon them, and showed the contrast between such a state of oppression and their present comparatively free and prosperous condition. Their king would imitate the pomp and luxury of other monarchs, to support which, grievous exactions upon their persons and property would be necessary. The goodliest of their young men he would require for his service. They would be made charioteers and horsemen and runners before him. They must fill the ranks of his army, and they would be required to till his fields, to reap his harvests, and to manufacture implements of war for his service. The daughters of Israel would be for confectioners and bakers for the royal household. To support his kingly state he would seize upon the best of their lands, bestowed upon the people by Jehovah Himself. The most valuable of their servants also, and of their cattle, he would take, and \"put them to his work.\" Besides all this, the king would require a tenth of all their income, the profits of their labor, or the products of the soil. \"Ye shall be his servants,\" concluded the prophet. \"And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day.\" However burdensome its exactions should be found, when once a monarchy was established, they could not set it aside at pleasure. \n                                                                           607", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 606}
