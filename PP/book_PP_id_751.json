{"word": "Do we well to be thus unbelieving? Why should we be ungrateful and distrustful? Jesus is our friend; all heaven is interested in our welfare; and our anxiety and fear grieve the Holy Spirit of God. We should not indulge in a solicitude that only frets and wears us, but does not help us to bear trials. No place should be given to that distrust of God which leads us to make a preparation against future want the chief pursuit of life, as though our happiness consisted in these earthly things. It is not the will of God that His people should be weighed down with care. But our Lord does not tell us that there are no dangers in our path. He does not propose to take His people out of the world of sin and evil, but He points us to a never-failing refuge. He invites the weary and care-laden, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" Lay off the yoke of anxiety and worldly care that you have placed on your own neck, and \"take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" Matthew 11:28, 29. We may find rest and peace in God, casting all our care upon Him; for He careth for us. See 1 Peter 5:7.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 294}
