It not only pointed back to the wilderness sojourn, but, as the feast of harvest, it celebrated the ingathering of the fruits of the earth, and pointed forward to the great day of final ingathering, when the Lord of the harvest shall send forth His reapers to gather the tares together in bundles for the fire, and to gather the wheat into His garner. At that time the wicked will all be destroyed. They will become \"as though they had not been.\" Obadiah 16. And every voice in the whole universe will unite in joyful praise to God. Says the revelator, \"Every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.\" Revelation 5:13. \n                                                                           542", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 541}
