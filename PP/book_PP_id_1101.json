But their stubborn persistence sealed their doom. The entire congregation were sharers in their guilt, for all had, to a greater or less degree, sympathized with them. Yet God in His great mercy made a distinction between the leaders in rebellion and those whom they had led.

The signal manifestation of God's power had removed all uncertainty.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 401}
