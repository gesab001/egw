{"word": "Hidden by the deep shadows of the hills, David and his attendant entered the encampment of the enemy. As they sought to ascertain the exact number of their foes, they came upon Saul sleeping, his spear stuck in the ground, and a cruse of water at his head. Beside him lay Abner, his chief commander, and all around them were the soldiers, locked in slumber. Abishai raised his spear, and said to David, \"God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite \n                                                                           671\nhim, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.\" He waited for the word of permission; but there fell upon his ear the whispered words: \"Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed, and be guiltless? . . . As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish. The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go. So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.\" How easily the Lord can weaken the strongest, remove prudence from the wisest, and baffle the skill of the most watchful!", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 668}
