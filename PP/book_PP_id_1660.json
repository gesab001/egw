{"word": "\"Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.\" This expedition was undertaken by the Israelites without counsel from God, without the concurrence of high priest or prophet. \"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.\" As the shattered and disheartened force returned to their encampment, \"the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines?\" The nation was ripe for the judgments of God, yet they did not see that their own sins had been the cause of this terrible disaster. And they said, \"Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.\" The Lord had given no command or permission that the ark should come into the army; yet the Israelites felt confident that victory would be theirs, and uttered a great shout when it was borne into the camp by the sons of Eli.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 583}
