{"word": "The first shock of the fearful tidings past, David's thoughts returned to the stranger herald, and the crime of which, according to his own statement, he was guilty. The chief demanded of the young man, \"Whence art thou?\" And he answered, \"I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?\" Twice David had had Saul in his power; but when urged to slay him, he had refused to lift his hand against him who had been consecrated by the command of God to rule over Israel.

David said, \"Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord's anointed.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 695}
