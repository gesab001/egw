{"word": "Saul, however, did not long remain friendly to David. When Saul and David were returning from battle with the Philistines, \"the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.\" One company sang, \"Saul hath slain his thousands,\" while another company took up the strain, and responded, \"And David his ten thousands.\" The demon of jealousy entered the heart of the king. He was angry because David was exalted above himself in the song of the women of Israel. In place of subduing these envious feelings, he displayed the weakness of his character, and exclaimed. \"They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 650}
