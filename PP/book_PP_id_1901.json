{"word": "\"And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.\" The death of Samuel was regarded as an irreparable loss by the nation of Israel. A great and good prophet and an eminent judge had fallen in death, and the grief of the people was deep and heartfelt. From his youth up Samuel had walked before Israel in the integrity of his heart; although Saul had been the acknowledged king, Samuel had wielded a more powerful influence than he, because his record was one of faithfulness, obedience, and devotion. We read that he judged Israel all the days of his life.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 663}
