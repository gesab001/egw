He has linked us to Himself by unnumbered tokens in heaven and in earth. This world is not all sorrow and misery. \"God is love,\" is written upon every opening bud, upon the petals of every flower, and upon every spire of grass. Though the curse of sin has caused the earth to bring forth thorns and thistles, there are flowers upon the thistles and the thorns are hidden by roses. All things in nature testify to the tender, fatherly care of our God and to His desire to make His children happy. His prohibitions and injunctions are not intended merely to display His authority, but in all that He does He has the well-being of His children in view. He does not require them to give up anything that it would be for their best interest to retain.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 599}
