{"word": "The ark remained at Shiloh for three hundred years, until, because of the sins of Eli's house, it fell into the hands of the Philistines, and Shiloh was ruined. The ark was never returned to the tabernacle here, the sanctuary service was finally transferred to the temple at Jerusalem, and Shiloh fell into insignificance. There are only ruins to mark the spot where it once stood. Long afterward its fate was made use of as a warning to Jerusalem. \"Go ye now unto My place which was in Shiloh,\" the Lord declared by the prophet Jeremiah, \"where I set My name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of My people Israel. . . . Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by My name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which \n                                                                           515\nI gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.\" Jeremiah 7:12-14.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 514}
