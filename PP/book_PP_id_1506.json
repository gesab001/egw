{"word": "To the poor, the seventh year was a year of release from debt. The Hebrews were enjoined at all times to assist their needy brethren by lending them money without interest. To take usury from a poor man was expressly forbidden: \"If thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.\" Leviticus 25:35-37. If the debt remained unpaid \n                                                                           533\nuntil the year of release, the principal itself could not be recovered. The people were expressly warned against withholding from their brethren needed assistance on account of this: \"If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren, . . . thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother. . . . Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the Lord against thee, and it be sin unto thee.\" \"The poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land,\" \"and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.\" Deuteronomy 15:7-9, 11, 8.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 532}
