{"word": "The terms of the \"old covenant\" were, Obey and live: \"If a man do, he shall even live in them\" (Ezekiel 20:11; Leviticus 18:5); but \"cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them.\" Deuteronomy 27:26. The \"new covenant\" was established upon \"better promises\"--the promise of forgiveness of sins and of the grace of God to renew the heart and bring it into harmony with the principles of God's law. \"This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts. . . . I will forgive their iniquity, and will remember their sin no more.\" Jeremiah 31:33, 34.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 372}
