It is not enough even that we believe on Christ for the forgiveness of sin; we must by faith be constantly receiving spiritual strength and nourishment from Him through His word.

The spirit and work of Christ must become the spirit and work of His disciples.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 277}
