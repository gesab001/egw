{"word": "The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone is written by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart. Instead of going about to establish our own righteousness we accept the righteousness of Christ. His blood atones for our sins. His obedience is accepted for us. Then the heart renewed by the Holy Spirit will bring forth \"the fruits of the Spirit.\" Through the grace of Christ we shall live in obedience to the law of God written upon our hearts. Having the Spirit of Christ, we shall walk even as He walked. Through the prophet He declared of Himself, \"I delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.\" Psalm 40:8. And when among men He said, \"The Father hath not left Me alone; for I do always those things that please Him.\" John 8:29. \n                                                                           373", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 372}
