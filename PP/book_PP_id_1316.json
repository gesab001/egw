{"word": "That very day there came to Moses the command, \"Get thee up . . . unto Mount Nebo, . . . and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession: and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people.\" Moses had often left the camp, in obedience to the divine summons, to commune with God; but he was now to depart on a new and mysterious errand. He must go forth to resign his life into the hands of his Creator. Moses knew that he was to die alone; no earthly friend would be permitted to minister to him in his last hours.

But he had learned to trust in God, and with unquestioning faith he committed himself and his people to His love and mercy.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 470}
