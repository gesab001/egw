{"word": "It was by associating with idolaters and joining in their festivities that the Hebrews were led to transgress God's law and bring His judgments upon the nation. So now it is by leading the followers of Christ to associate with the ungodly and unite in their amusements that Satan is most successful in alluring them into sin. \"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean.\" 2 Corinthians 6:17. God requires of His people now as great a distinction from the world, in customs, habits, and principles, as He required of Israel anciently. If they faithfully follow the teachings of His word, this distinction will exist; it cannot be otherwise. The warnings given to the Hebrews against assimilating with the heathen were not more direct or explicit than are those forbidding Christians to conform to the spirit and customs of the ungodly. Christ speaks to us, \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\" 1 John 2:15. \"The friendship of the \n                                                                           459\nworld is enmity with God; whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\" James 4:4. The followers of Christ are to separate themselves from sinners, choosing their society only when there is opportunity to do them good. We cannot be too decided in shunning the company of those who exert an influence to draw us away from God. While we pray, \"Lead us not into temptation,\" we are to shun temptation, so far as possible.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 458}
