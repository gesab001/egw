{"word": "He that ruleth in the heavens is the one who sees the end from the beginning--the one before whom the mysteries of the past and the future are alike outspread, and who, beyond the woe and darkness and ruin that sin has wrought, beholds the accomplishment of His own purposes of love and blessing. Though \"clouds and darkness are round about Him: righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.\" Psalm 97:2, R.V. And this the inhabitants of the universe, both loyal and disloyal, will one day understand. \"His work is perfect: for all His ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is He.\" Deuteronomy 32:4.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 43}
