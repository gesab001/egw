{"word": "Heretofore David's record as a ruler had been such as few monarchs have ever equaled. It is written of him that he \"executed judgment and justice unto all his people.\" 2 Samuel 8:15. His integrity had won the confidence and fealty of the nation. But as he departed from God and yielded himself to the wicked one, he became for the time the agent of Satan; yet he still held the position and authority that God had given him, and because of this, claimed obedience that would imperil the soul of him who should yield it. And Joab, whose allegiance had been given to the king rather than to God, transgressed God's law because the king commanded it.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 719}
