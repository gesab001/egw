{"word": "At midnight \"there was a great cry in Egypt: for there was \n                                                                           280\nnot a house where there was not one dead.\" All the first-born in the land, \"from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle\" had been smitten by the destroyer. Throughout the vast realm of Egypt the pride of every household had been laid low. The shrieks and wails of the mourners filled the air. King and courtiers, with blanched faces and trembling limbs, stood aghast at the overmastering horror. Pharaoh remembered how he had once exclaimed, \"Who is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.\" Now, his heaven-daring pride humbled in the dust, he \"called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the Lord, as ye have said. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said. . . . And be gone; and bless me also.\" The royal counselors also and the people entreated the Israelites to depart \"out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.\"", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 279}
