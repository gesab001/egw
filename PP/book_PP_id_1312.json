{"word": "The infinite love of God has been manifested in the gift of His only-begotten Son to redeem a lost race. Christ came to the earth to reveal to men the character of His Father, and His life was filled with deeds of divine tenderness and compassion. And yet Christ Himself declares, \"Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law.\" Matthew 5:18. The same voice that with patient, loving entreaty invites the sinner to come to Him and find pardon and peace, will in the judgment bid the rejecters of His mercy, \"Depart from Me, ye cursed.\" Matthew 25:41. In all the Bible, God is represented not only as a tender father but as a righteous judge. Though He delights in showing mercy, and \"forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,\" yet He \"will by no means clear the guilty.\" Exodus 34:7.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 469}
