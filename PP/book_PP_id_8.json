{"word": "Little by little Lucifer came to indulge the desire for self-exaltation. The Scripture says, \"Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.\" Ezekiel 28:17. \"Thou hast said in thine heart, . . . I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. . . . I will be like the Most High.\" Isaiah 14:13, 14. Though all his glory was from God, this mighty angel came to regard it as pertaining to himself. Not content with his position, though honored above the heavenly host, he ventured to covet homage due alone to the Creator. Instead of seeking to make God supreme in the affections and allegiance of all created beings, it was his endeavor to secure their service and loyalty to himself. And coveting the glory with which the infinite Father had invested His Son, this prince of angels aspired to power that was the prerogative of Christ alone.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 35}
