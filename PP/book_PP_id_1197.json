{"word": "Nothing but the righteousness of Christ can entitle us to one of the blessings of the covenant of grace. There are many who have long desired and tried to obtain these blessings, but have not received them, because they have cherished the idea that they could do something to make themselves worthy of them. They have not looked away from self, believing that Jesus is an all-sufficient Saviour. We must not think that our own merits will save us; Christ is our only hope of salvation. \"For there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" Acts 4:12.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 431}
