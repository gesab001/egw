{"word": "But the word of God had not failed; neither did it meet its final accomplishment in the occupation of Canaan by the Jewish people. \"To Abraham and his seed were the promises made.\" \n                                                                           170\nGalatians 3:16. Abraham himself was to share the inheritance. The fulfillment of God's promise may seem to be long delayed--for \"one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day\" (2 Peter 3:8); it may appear to tarry; but at the appointed time \"it will surely come, it will not tarry.\" Habakkuk 2:3. The gift to Abraham and his seed included not merely the land of Canaan, but the whole earth. So says the apostle, \"The promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.\" Romans 4:13. And the Bible plainly teaches that the promises made to Abraham are to be fulfilled through Christ. All that are Christ's are \"Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise\"--heirs to \"an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away\"--the earth freed from the curse of sin. Galatians 3:29; 1 Peter 1:4. For \"the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High;\" and \"the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.\" Daniel 7:27; Psalm 37:11.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 169}
