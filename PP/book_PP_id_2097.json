Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.\" The king's sons, returning in alarm to Jerusalem, revealed to their father the truth; Amnon alone had been slain; and they \"lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.\" But Absalom fled to Talmai, the king of Geshur, his mother's father.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 727}
