{"word": "The warning given to our first parents--\"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die\" (Genesis 2:17)--did not imply that they were to die on the very day when they partook of the forbidden fruit. But on that day the irrevocable sentence would be pronounced. Immortality was promised them on condition of obedience; by transgression they would forfeit eternal life. That very day they would be doomed to death.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 60}
