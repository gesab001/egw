{"word": "The great lesson here taught is for all time. Often the Christian life is beset by dangers, and duty seems hard to perform. The imagination pictures impending ruin before and bondage or death behind. Yet the voice of God speaks clearly, \"Go forward.\" We should obey this command, even though our eyes cannot penetrate the darkness, and we feel the cold waves about our feet. The obstacles that hinder our progress will never disappear before a halting, doubting spirit. Those who defer obedience till every shadow of uncertainty disappears and there remains no risk of failure or defeat, will never obey at all. Unbelief whispers, \"Let us wait till the obstructions are removed, and we can see our way clearly;\" but faith courageously urges an advance, hoping all things, believing all things.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 290}
