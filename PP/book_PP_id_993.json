{"word": "Idolatry and all the sins that followed in its train were abhorrent to God, and He commanded His people not to mingle with other nations, to \"do after their works,\" and forget God. He forbade their marriage with idolaters, lest their hearts should be led away from Him. It was just as necessary then as it is now that God's people should be pure, \"unspotted from the world.\" They must keep themselves free from its spirit, because it is opposed to truth and righteousness. But God did not intend that His people, in self-righteous exclusiveness, should shut themselves away from the world, so that they could have no influence upon it.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 369}
