{"word": "Moses did not conceal his sentence, but told the people that since he had failed to ascribe glory to God, he could not lead them into the Promised Land. He bade them mark the severe punishment visited upon him, and then consider how God must regard their murmurings in charging upon a mere man the judgments which they had by their sins brought upon themselves. He told them how he had pleaded with God for a remission of the sentence, and had been refused. \"The Lord was wroth with me for your sakes,\" he said, \"and would not hear me.\" Deuteronomy 3:26.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 419}
