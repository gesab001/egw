{"word": "A short distance from Jordan the Hebrews made their first encampment in Canaan. Here Joshua \"circumcised the children of Israel;\" \"and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover.\" The suspension of the rite of circumcision since the rebellion at Kadesh had been a constant witness to Israel that their covenant with God, of which it was the appointed symbol, had been broken. And the discontinuance of the Passover, the memorial of their deliverance from Egypt, had been an evidence of the Lord's displeasure at their desire to return to the land of bondage. Now, however, the years of rejection were ended. Once more God acknowledged Israel as His people, and the sign of the covenant was restored. The rite of circumcision was performed upon all the people who had been born in the wilderness. And the Lord declared to Joshua, \"This \n                                                                           486\nday have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you,\" and in allusion to this the place of their encampment was called Gilgal, \"a rolling away,\" or \"rolling off.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 485}
