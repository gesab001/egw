{"word": "God had made it their privilege and their duty to enter the land at the time of His appointment, but through their willful neglect that permission had been withdrawn. Satan had gained his object in preventing them from entering Canaan; and now he urged them on to do the very thing, in the face of the divine prohibition, which they had refused to do when God required it. Thus the great deceiver gained the victory by leading them to rebellion the second time. They had distrusted the power of God to work with their efforts in gaining possession of Canaan; yet now they presumed upon their own strength to accomplish the work independent of divine aid. \"We have sinned against the Lord,\" they cried; \"we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us.\" Deuteronomy 1:41. So terribly blinded had they become by transgression. The Lord had never commanded them to \"go up and fight.\" It was not His purpose that they should gain the land by warfare, but by strict obedience to His commands.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 392}
