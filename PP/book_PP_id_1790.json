{"word": "Those who are most ready to excuse or justify themselves in sin are often most severe in judging and condemning others. Many, like Saul, bring upon themselves the displeasure of God, but they reject counsel and despise reproof. Even when convinced that the Lord is not with them, they refuse to see in themselves the cause of their trouble. They cherish a proud, boastful spirit, while they indulge in cruel judgment or severe rebuke of others who are better than they. Well would it be for such self-constituted judges to ponder those words of Christ: \"With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" Matthew 7:2.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 625}
