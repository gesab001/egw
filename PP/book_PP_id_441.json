Christ, in His relation to His people, is compared to a shepherd. After the Fall He saw His sheep doomed to perish in the dark ways of sin.

He says, \"I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick.\" I will \"save My flock, and they shall no more be a prey.\" \"Neither shall the beast of the land devour them.\" Ezekiel 34:16, 22, 28. His voice is heard calling them to His fold, \"a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.\" Isaiah 4:6. His care for the flock is unwearied. He strengthens the weak, relieves the suffering, gathers the lambs in His arms, and carries them in His bosom. His sheep love Him. \"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers.\" John 10:5.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 190}
