{"word": "For some time the two classes remained separate. The race of Cain, spreading from the place of their first settlement, dispersed over the plains and valleys where the children of Seth had dwelt; and the latter, in order to escape from their contaminating influence, withdrew to the mountains, and there made their home. So long as this separation continued, they maintained the worship of God in its purity. But in the lapse of time they ventured, little by little, to mingle with the inhabitants of the valleys. This association was productive of the worst results. \"The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair.\" The children of Seth, attracted by the beauty of the daughters of Cain's descendants, displeased the Lord by intermarrying with them. Many of the worshipers of God were beguiled into sin by the allurements that were now constantly before them, and they lost their peculiar, holy character. Mingling with the depraved, they became like them in spirit and in deeds; the restrictions of the seventh commandment were disregarded, \"and they took them wives of all which they chose.\" The children of Seth went \n                                                                           82\n\"in the way of Cain\" (Jude 11); they fixed their minds upon worldly prosperity and enjoyment and neglected the commandments of the Lord. Men \"did not like to retain God in their knowledge;\" they \"became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\" Romans 1:21. Therefore \"God gave them over to a mind void of judgment.\" Verse 28, margin. Sin spread abroad in the earth like a deadly leprosy.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 81}
