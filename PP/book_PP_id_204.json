{"word": "Noah and his family anxiously waited for the decrease of the waters, for they longed to go forth again upon the earth. Forty days after the tops of the mountains became visible, they sent out a raven, a bird of quick scent, to discover whether the earth had become dry. This bird, finding nothing but water, continued to fly to and from the ark. Seven days later a dove was sent forth, which, finding no footing, returned to the ark. Noah waited seven days longer, and again sent forth the dove. When she returned at evening with an olive leaf in her mouth, there was great rejoicing. Later \"Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.\" Still he waited patiently within the ark. As he had entered at God's command, he waited for special directions to depart.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 105}
