{"word": "Chap. 37 - The Smitten Rock\n\n     From the smitten rock in Horeb first flowed the living stream that refreshed Israel in the desert. During all their wanderings, wherever the need existed, they were supplied with water by a miracle of God's mercy. The water did not, however, continue to flow from Horeb. Wherever in their journeyings they wanted water, there from the clefts of the rock it gushed out beside their encampment.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 411}
