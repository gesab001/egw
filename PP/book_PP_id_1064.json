{"word": "In their rebellion the people had exclaimed, \"Would God we had died in this wilderness!\" Now this prayer was to be granted. The Lord declared: \"As ye have spoken in Mine ears, so will I do to you: your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward. . . . But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.\" And of Caleb He said, \"My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed Me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.\" As the spies had spent forty days in their journey, so the hosts of Israel were to wander in the wilderness forty years.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 391}
