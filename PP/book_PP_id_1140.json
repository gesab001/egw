{"word": "The Saviour made use of this symbolic service to direct the minds of the people to the blessings that He had come to bring them. \"In the last day, that great day of the feast,\" His voice was heard in tones that rang through the temple courts, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\" \"This,\" said John, \"spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive.\" John 7:37-39. The refreshing water, welling up in a parched and barren land, causing the desert place to blossom, and flowing out to give life to the perishing, is an emblem of the divine grace which Christ alone can bestow, and which is as the living water, purifying, refreshing, and invigorating the soul. He in whom Christ is abiding has within him a never-failing fountain of grace and strength. Jesus cheers the life and brightens the path of all who truly seek Him. His love, received into the heart, will spring up in good works unto eternal life. And not only does it bless the soul in which it springs, but the living stream will flow out in words and deeds of righteousness, to refresh the thirsting around him.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 412}
