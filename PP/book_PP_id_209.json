{"word": "With the assurance given to Noah concerning the Flood, God Himself has linked one of the most precious promises of His grace: \"As I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee.\" Isaiah 54:9, 10.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 107}
