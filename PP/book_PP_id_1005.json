{"word": "The apostle Paul clearly presents the relation between faith and the law under the new covenant. He says: \"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" \"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\" \"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh\"--it could not justify man, because in his sinful nature he could not keep the law--\"God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" Romans 5:1; 3:31; 8:3, 4.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 373}
