{"word": "God's promise that through Samson He would \"begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines\" was fulfilled; but how dark and terrible the record of that life which might have been a praise to God and a glory to the nation! Had Samson been true to his divine calling, the purpose of God could have been accomplished in his honor and exaltation. But he yielded to temptation and proved untrue to his trust, and his mission was fulfilled in defeat, bondage, and death.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 567}
