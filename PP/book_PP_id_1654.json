{"word": "\"The word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision. And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; that the Lord called Samuel.\" Supposing the voice to be that of Eli, the child hastened to the bedside of the priest, saying, \"Here am I; for thou calledst me.\" The answer was, \"I called not, my son; lie down again.\" Three times Samuel was called, and thrice he responded in like manner. And then Eli was convinced that the mysterious call was the voice of God. The Lord had passed by His chosen servant, the man of hoary hairs, to commune with a child. This in itself was a bitter yet deserved rebuke to Eli and his house.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 581}
