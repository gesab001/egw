{"word": "Balaam owed the preservation of his life to the poor animal that he had treated so cruelly. The man who claimed to be a prophet of the Lord, who declared that his eyes were open, and he saw the \"vision of the Almighty,\" was so blinded by covetousness and ambition that he could not discern the angel of God visible to his beast. \"The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.\" 2 Corinthians 4:4. How many are thus blinded! They rush on in forbidden paths, transgressing the divine law, and cannot discern that God and His angels are against them. Like Balaam they are angry at those who would prevent their ruin.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 442}
