{"word": "Saul was the son of a powerful and wealthy chief, yet in accordance with the simplicity of the times he was engaged with his father in the humble duties of a husbandman. Some of his father's animals having strayed upon the mountains, Saul went with a servant to seek for them. For three days they searched in vain, when, as they were not far from Ramah, [SEE APPENDIX, NOTE 9.] the home of Samuel, the servant proposed that they should inquire of the prophet concerning the missing property. \"I have here at hand \n                                                                           609\nthe fourth part of a shekel of silver,\" he said: \"that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.\" This was in accordance with the custom of the times. A person approaching a superior in rank or office made him a small present, as an expression of respect.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 608}
