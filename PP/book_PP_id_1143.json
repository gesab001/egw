{"word": "Isaiah describes Him as the \"rock of ages,\" and \"the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.\" Isaiah 26:4 (margin); 32:2. And he records the precious promise, bringing vividly to mind the living stream that flowed for Israel: \"When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.\" \"I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground;\" \"in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.\" The invitation is given, \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.\" Isaiah 41:17; 44:3; Isaiah 35:6; 55:1. And in the closing pages of the Sacred Word this invitation is echoed. The river of the water of life, \"clear as crystal,\" proceeds from the throne of God and the Lamb; and the gracious call is ringing down through the ages, \"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\" Revelation 22:17.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 413}
