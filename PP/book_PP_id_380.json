{"word": "The heritage that God has promised to His people is not in this world. Abraham had no possession in the earth, \"no, not so much as to set his foot on.\" Acts 7:5. He possessed great substance, and he used it to the glory of God and the good of his fellow men; but he did not look upon this world as his home. The Lord had called him to leave his idolatrous countrymen, with the promise of the land of Canaan as an everlasting possession; yet neither he nor his son nor his son's son received it. When Abraham desired a burial place for his dead, he had to buy it of the Canaanites. His sole possession in the Land of Promise was that rock-hewn tomb in the cave of Machpelah.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 169}
