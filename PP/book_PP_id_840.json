{"word": "God's covenant with His people had been disannulled, and He declared to Moses, \"Let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.\" The people of Israel, especially the mixed multitude, would be constantly disposed to rebel against God. They would also murmur against their leader, and would grieve him by their unbelief and stubbornness, and it would be a laborious and soul-trying work to lead them through to the Promised Land. Their sins had already forfeited the favor of God, and justice called for their destruction. The Lord therefore proposed to destroy them, and make of Moses a mighty nation.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 318}
