{"word": "THE WORSHIP OF APIS WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH THE GROSSEST LICENTIOUSNESS, AND THE SCRIPTURE RECORD INDICATES THAT THE CALF WORSHIP BY THE ISRAELITES WAS ATTENDED WITH ALL THE LICENSE USUAL IN HEATHEN WORSHIP. WE READ: \"THEY ROSE UP EARLY ON THE MORROW, AND OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS, AND BROUGHT PEACE OFFERINGS; AND THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND TO DRINK, AND ROSE UP TO PLAY.\" EXODUS 32:6. THE HEBREW WORD RENDERED \"TO PLAY\" SIGNIFIES PLAYING WITH LEAPING, SINGING, AND DANCING. THIS DANCING, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE EGYPTIANS, WAS SENSUAL AND INDECENT. THE WORD RENDERED \"CORRUPTED\" IN THE NEXT VERSE, WHERE IT IS SAID, \"THY PEOPLE, WHICH THOU BROUGHTEST OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, HAVE CORRUPTED THEMSELVES,\" IS THE SAME THAT IS USED IN GENESIS 6:11, 12, WHERE WE READ THAT THE EARTH WAS CORRUPT, \"FOR ALL FLESH HAD CORRUPTED HIS WAY UPON THE EARTH.\" THIS EXPLAINS THE TERRIBLE ANGER OF THE LORD, AND WHY HE DESIRED TO CONSUME THE PEOPLE AT ONCE.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 760}
