{"word": "When Cain saw that his offering was rejected, he was angry with the Lord and with Abel; he was angry that God did not accept man's substitute in place of the sacrifice divinely ordained, and angry with his brother for choosing to obey God \n                                                                           74\ninstead of joining in rebellion against Him. Notwithstanding Cain's disregard of the divine command, God did not leave him to himself; but He condescended to reason with the man who had shown himself so unreasonable. And the Lord said unto Cain, \"Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?\" Through an angel messenger the divine warning was conveyed: \"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.\" The choice lay with Cain himself. If he would trust to the merits of the promised Saviour, and would obey God's requirements, he would enjoy His favor. But should he persist in unbelief and transgression, he would have no ground for complaint because he was rejected by the Lord.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 73}
