When the priest accepted the gift, the offerer, speaking as in the presence of Jehovah, said, \"A Syrian ready to perish was my father;\" and he described the sojourn in Egypt and the affliction from which God had delivered Israel \"with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders.\" And he said, \"He hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this \n                                                                           527\nland, even a land that floweth with milk and honey. And now, behold, I have brought the first fruits of the land, which Thou, Jehovah, hast given me.\" Deuteronomy 26:5, 8-11.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 526}
