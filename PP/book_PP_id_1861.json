{"word": "As Saul's hatred of David increased, he became more and more watchful to find an opportunity to take his life; but none of his plans against the anointed of the Lord were successful. Saul gave himself up to the control of the wicked spirit that ruled over him; while David trusted in Him who is mighty in counsel, and strong to deliver. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\" (Proverbs 9:10), and David's prayer was continually directed to God, that he might walk before Him in a perfect way.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 651}
