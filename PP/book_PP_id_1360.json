Withdrawing from the encampment to meditate and to pray that the God of Israel would go before His people, he beheld an armed warrior, of lofty stature and commanding presence, \"with his sword drawn in his hand.\" To Joshua's challenge, \"Art thou for us, or for \n                                                                           488\nour adversaries?\" the answer was given, \"As Captain of the host of the Lord am I now come.\" The same command given to Moses in Horeb, \"Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy,\" revealed the true character of the mysterious stranger. It was Christ, the Exalted One, who stood before the leader of Israel. Awe-stricken, Joshua fell upon his face and worshiped, and heard the assurance, \"I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor,\" and he received instruction for the capture of the city.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 487}
