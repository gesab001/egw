{"word": "Said our Saviour: \"Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth\"--upon all whose interests are centered in this world. \"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.\" Luke 21:34-36.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 166}
