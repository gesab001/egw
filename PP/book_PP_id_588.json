{"word": "For most of his children Jacob foretold a prosperous future. At last the name of Joseph was reached, and the father's heart overflowed as he invoked blessings upon \"the head of him that was separate from his brethren\": \n\n\n     \"Joseph is a fruitful bough, \n      Even a fruitful bough by a well; \n      Whose branches run over the wall: \n      The archers have sorely grieved him, \n      And shot at him, and hated him: \n      But his bow abode in strength, \n      And the arms of his hands were made strong \n      By the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; \n      (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel;) \n                                                                           237\n\n      Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; \n      And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee \n      With blessings of heaven above, \n      Blessings of the deep that lieth under, \n      Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: \n      The blessings of thy father have prevailed \n      Above the blessings of my progenitors \n      Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: \n      They shall be on the head of Joseph, \n      And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from \n           his brethren.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 236}
