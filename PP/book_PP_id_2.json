The psalmist says: \n\n       \"Strong is Thy hand, and high is Thy right hand. \n        Righteousness and judgment are the foundation of Thy throne: \n        Mercy and truth go before Thy face. \n        Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: \n        They walk, O Lord, in the light of Thy countenance. \n        In Thy name do they rejoice all the day: \n        And in Thy righteousness are they exalted. \n        For Thou art the glory of their strength: . . . \n        For our shield belongeth unto Jehovah, \n        And our king to the Holy One.\" \n\nNOTE: Psalm 89:13-18, R.V.
