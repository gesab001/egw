They \"speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily\" (Psalm 73:8), trampling upon human rights and disregarding divine authority. The proud may be for a time in great power, and may see success in all that they undertake; but in the end they will find only disappointment and wretchedness.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 124}
