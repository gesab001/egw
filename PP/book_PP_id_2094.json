{"word": "Whoever under the reproof of God will humble the soul with confession and repentance, as did David, may be sure that there is hope for him. Whoever will in faith accept God's promises, will find pardon. The Lord will never cast away one truly repentant soul. He has given this promise: \"Let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.\" Isaiah 27:5. \"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\" Isaiah 55:7.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 726}
