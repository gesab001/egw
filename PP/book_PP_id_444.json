{"word": "To save His sheep, Christ laid down His own life; and He points His shepherds to the love thus manifested, as their example. But \"he that is an hireling, . . . whose own the sheep are not,\" has no real interest in the flock. He is laboring merely for gain, and he cares only for himself. He studies his own profit instead of the interest of his charge; and in time of peril or danger he will flee, and leave the flock.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 191}
