{"word": "\"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.\" But there was one who was not deceived--one who clearly foresaw the result of this fatal mistake of Absalom's. Ahithophel knew that the cause of the rebels was lost. And he knew that whatever might be the fate of the prince, there was no hope for the counselor who had instigated his greatest crimes. Ahithophel had encouraged Absalom in rebellion; he had counseled him to the most abominable wickedness, to the dishonor of his father; he had advised the slaying of David and had planned its accomplishment; he had cut off the last possibility of his own reconciliation with the king; and now another was preferred before him, even by Absalom. Jealous, angry, and desperate, Ahithophel \"gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died.\" Such was the result of the wisdom of one, who, with all his high endowments, did not make God his counselor. Satan allures men with flattering promises, but in the end it will be found by every soul, that the \"wages of sin is death.\" Romans 6:23.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 741}
