{"word": "Moses was next directed to take ashes of the furnace, and \"sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.\" This act was deeply significant. Four hundred years before, God had shown to Abraham the future oppression of His people, under the figure of a smoking furnace and a burning lamp. He had declared that He would visit judgments upon their oppressors, and would bring forth the captives with great substance. In Egypt, Israel had long languished in the furnace of affliction. This act of Moses was an assurance to them that God was mindful of His covenant, and that the time for their deliverance had come.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 267}
