{"word": "When he beheld the messenger of God, Balaam exclaimed in terror, \"I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.\" The Lord suffered him to proceed on his journey, but gave him to understand that his words should be controlled by divine power. God would give evidence to Moab that the Hebrews were under the guardianship of Heaven, and this He did effectually when He showed them how powerless Balaam was even to utter a curse against them without divine permission.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 443}
