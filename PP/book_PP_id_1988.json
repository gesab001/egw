{"word": "When David had invaded the territory of the Amalekites, he had put to the sword all the inhabitants that fell into his hands. \n                                                                           694\nBut for the restraining power of God the Amalekites would have retaliated by destroying the people of Ziklag. They decided to spare the captives, desiring to heighten the honor of the triumph by leading home a large number of prisoners, and intending afterward to sell them as slaves. Thus, unwittingly, they fulfilled God's purpose, keeping the prisoners unharmed, to be restored to their husbands and fathers.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 693}
