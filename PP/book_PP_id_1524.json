{"word": "Nature's gladness awakened joy in the hearts of Israel and gratitude to the Giver of all good. The grand Hebrew psalms were chanted, exalting the glory and majesty of Jehovah. At the sound of the signal trumpet, with the music of cymbals, the chorus of thanksgiving arose, swelled by hundreds of voices: \n\n\n          \"I was glad when they said unto me, \n           Let us go unto the house of the Lord. \n           Our feet are standing \n           Within thy gates, O Jerusalem. . . . \n           Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord, . . . \n           To give thanks unto the name of Jehovah. . . . \n           Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: \n           They shall prosper that love thee.\" Psalm 122:1-6, R.V.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 538}
