{"word": "Joshua appealed to the people themselves as witnesses that, so far as they had complied with the conditions, God had faithfully fulfilled His promises to them. \"Ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls,\" he said, \"that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.\" He declared to them that as the Lord had fulfilled His promises, so He would fulfill His threatenings. \"It shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the Lord your God promised you; so shall the Lord bring upon you all evil things. . . . When ye have transgressed the covenant of the Lord, . . . then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which He hath given unto you.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 522}
