{"word": "In the night season the Lord appeared to Balaam and said, \"If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.\" Thus far the Lord would permit Balaam to follow his own will, because he was determined upon it. He did not seek to do the will of God, but chose his own course, and then endeavored to secure the sanction of the Lord.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 440}
