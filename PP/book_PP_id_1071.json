{"word": "The Lord still works in a similar manner to glorify His name by bringing men to acknowledge His justice. When those who profess to love Him complain of His providence, despise His promises, and, yielding to temptation, unite with evil angels to defeat the purposes of God, the Lord often so overrules circumstances as to bring these persons where, though they may have no real repentance, they will be convinced of their sin and will be constrained to acknowledge the wickedness of their course and the justice and goodness of God in His dealings with them. It is thus that God sets counteragencies at work to make manifest the works of darkness. And though the spirit which prompted to the evil course is not radically changed, confessions are made that vindicate the honor of God and justify His faithful reprovers, who have been opposed and misrepresented. Thus it will be when the wrath of God shall be finally poured out. When \"the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to execute judgment upon all,\" He will also \"convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds.\" Jude 14, 15. Every sinner will be brought to see and acknowledge the justice of his condemnation.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 393}
