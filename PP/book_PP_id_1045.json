{"word": "Their accusations were borne by Moses in uncomplaining silence. It was the experience gained during the years of toil and waiting in Midian--the spirit of humility and long-suffering there developed--that prepared Moses to meet with patience the unbelief and murmuring of the people and the pride and envy of those who should have been his unswerving helpers. Moses \"was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth,\" and this is why he was granted divine wisdom and guidance above all others. Says the Scripture, \"The meek will He guide in judgment: and the meek will He teach His way.\" Psalm 25:9. The meek are guided by the Lord, because they are teachable, willing to be instructed. They have a sincere desire to know and to do the will of God. The Saviour's promise is, \"If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine.\" John 7:17. And He declares by the apostle James, \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" James 1:5. But His promise is only to those who are willing to follow the Lord wholly. God does not force the will of any; hence He cannot lead those who are too proud to be taught, who are bent upon having their own way. Of the double-minded man--he who seeks to follow his own will, while professing to do the will of God--it is written, \"Let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.\" James 1:7.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 384}
