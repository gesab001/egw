{"word": "The song in which David gave utterance to the feelings of his heart became a treasure to his nation, and to the people of God in all subsequent ages: \n\n\n          \"Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! \n           How are the mighty fallen! \n           Tell it not in Gath, \n           Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; \n           Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, \n           Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. \n           Ye mountains of Gilboa, \n           Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of \n              offerings: \n           For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, \n           The shield of Saul as of one not anointed with oil. . . . \n           Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, \n           And in their death they were not divided; \n           They were swifter than eagles, \n           They were stronger than lions. \n           Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, \n           Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, \n           Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel. \n           How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! \n           Jonathan is slain upon thy high places. \n           I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: \n           Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: \n           Thy love to me was wonderful, \n           Passing the love of women. \n           How are the mighty fallen, \n           And the weapons of war perished!\" \n                                          2 Samuel 1:19-27, R.V.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 696}
