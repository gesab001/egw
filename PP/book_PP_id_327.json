{"word": "Satan was at hand to suggest that he must be deceived, for the divine law commands, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" and God would not require what He had once forbidden. Going outside his tent, Abraham looked up to the calm brightness of the unclouded heavens, and recalled the promise made nearly fifty years before, that his seed should be innumerable as the stars. If this promise was to be fulfilled through Isaac, how could he be put to death? Abraham was tempted to believe that he might be under a delusion. In his doubt and anguish he bowed upon the earth, and prayed, as he had never prayed before, for some confirmation of the command if he must perform this terrible duty. He remembered the angels sent to reveal to him God's purpose to destroy Sodom, and who bore to him the promise of this same son Isaac, and he went to the place where he had several times met the heavenly messengers, hoping to meet them again, and receive some further direction; but none came to his relief. Darkness seemed to shut him in; but the command of God was sounding in his ears, \"Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest.\" That command must be obeyed, and he dared not delay. Day was approaching, and he must be on his journey.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 148}
