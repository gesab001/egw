{"word": "All the gleanings of harvest field, orchard, and vineyard, belonged to the poor. \"When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field,\" said Moses, \"and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it. . . . When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again. . . . When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt.\" Deuteronomy 24:19-22; Leviticus 19:9, 10.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 531}
