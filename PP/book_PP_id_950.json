{"word": "On the Day of Atonement two kids of the goats were brought to the door of the tabernacle, and lots were cast upon them, \"one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.\" The goat upon which the first lot fell was to be slain as a sin offering for the people. And the priest was to bring his blood within the veil, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat. \"And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgression in all their sins; and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 355}
