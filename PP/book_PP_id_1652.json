{"word": "In Eli's reproof to his sons are words of solemn and fearful import--words that all who minister in sacred things would do well to ponder: \"If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?\" Had their crimes injured only their fellow men, the judge might have made reconciliation by appointing a penalty and requiring restitution; and thus the offenders might have been pardoned. Or had they not been guilty of a presumptuous sin, a sin offering might have been presented for them. But their sins were so interwoven with their ministration as priests of the Most High, in offering sacrifice for sin, the work of God was so profaned and dishonored before the people, that no expiation could be accepted for them. Their own father, though himself high priest, dared not make intercession in their behalf; he could not shield them from the wrath of a holy God. Of all sinners, those are most guilty who cast contempt upon the means that Heaven has provided for man's redemption--who \"crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to an open shame.\" Hebrews 6:6.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 580}
