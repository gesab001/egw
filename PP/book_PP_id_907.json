{"word": "Never since man was created had there been witnessed such a manifestation of divine power as when the law was proclaimed from Sinai. \"The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.\" Psalm 68:8. Amid the most terrific convulsions of nature the voice of God, like a trumpet, was heard from the cloud. The mountain was shaken from base to summit, and the hosts of Israel, pale and trembling with terror, lay upon their faces upon the earth. He whose voice then shook the earth has declared, \"Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.\" Hebrews 12:26. Says the Scripture, \"The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation;\" \"and the heavens and the earth shall shake.\" Jeremiah 25:30; Joel 3:16. In that great coming day, the heaven itself shall depart \"as a scroll when it is rolled together.\" Revelation 6:14. And every mountain and island shall be moved out of its place. \"The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.\" Isaiah 24:20.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 340}
