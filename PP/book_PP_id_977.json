{"word": "There are many who try to blend these two systems, using the texts that speak of the ceremonial law to prove that the moral law has been abolished; but this is a perversion of the Scriptures. The distinction between the two systems is broad and clear. The ceremonial system was made up of symbols pointing to Christ, to His sacrifice and His priesthood. This ritual law, with its sacrifices and ordinances, was to be performed by the Hebrews until type met antitype in the death of Christ, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. Then all the sacrificial offerings were to cease. It is this law that Christ \"took . . . out of the way, nailing it to His cross.\" Colossians 2:14. But concerning the law of Ten Commandments the psalmist declares, \"Forever, O Lord, Thy word is settled in heaven.\" Psalm 119:89. And Christ Himself says, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law. . . . Verily I say unto you\"--making the assertion as emphatic as possible--\"Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\" Matthew 5:17, 18. Here He teaches, not merely what the claims of God's law had been, and were then, but that these claims should hold as long as the heavens and the earth remain. The law of God is as immutable as His throne. It will maintain its claims upon mankind in all ages.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 365}
