{"word": "The law of God, enshrined within the ark, was the great rule of righteousness and judgment. That law pronounced death upon the transgressor; but above the law was the mercy seat, upon which the presence of God was revealed, and from which, by virtue of the atonement, pardon was granted to the repentant sinner. Thus in the work of Christ for our redemption, symbolized by the sanctuary service, \"mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.\" Psalm 85:10.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 349}
