{"word": "The king of Moab, being informed of the approach of Balaam, went out with a large retinue to the borders of his kingdom, to receive him. When he expressed his astonishment at Balaam's delay, in view of the rich rewards awaiting him, the prophet's answer was, \"Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.\" Balaam greatly regretted this restriction; he feared that his purpose could not be carried out, because the Lord's controlling power was upon him.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 443}
