{"word": "Moses was a type of Christ. As Israel's intercessor veiled his countenance, because the people could not endure to look upon its glory, so Christ, the divine Mediator, veiled His divinity with humanity when He came to earth. Had He come clothed with the brightness of heaven, he could not have found access to men in their sinful state. They could not have endured the glory of His presence. Therefore He humbled Himself, and was made \"in the likeness of sinful flesh\" (Romans 8:3), that He might reach the fallen race, and lift them up.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 330}
