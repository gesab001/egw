If not fully routed, their enemies would again rally, and renew the struggle. \"Then spake Joshua to the Lord, . . . and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. . . . The sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 508}
