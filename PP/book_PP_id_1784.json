{"word": "Determined to make the most of his advantage, the king rashly forbade his soldiers to partake of food for the entire day, enforcing his command by the solemn imprecation, \"Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies.\" The victory had already been gained, without Saul's knowledge or co-operation, but he hoped to distinguish himself by the utter destruction of the vanquished army. The command to refrain from food was prompted by selfish ambition, and it showed the king to be indifferent to the needs of his people when these conflicted with his desire for self-exaltation. To confirm his prohibition by a solemn oath showed Saul to be both rash and profane. The very words of the curse give evidence that Saul's zeal was for himself, and not for the honor of God. He declared his object to be, not \"that the Lord may be avenged on His enemies,\" but \"that I may be avenged on mine enemies.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 624}
