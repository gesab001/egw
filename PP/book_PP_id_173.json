{"word": "The world was in its infancy; yet iniquity had become so deep and widespread that God could no longer bear with it; and He said, \"I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth.\" He declared that His Spirit should not always strive with the guilty race. If they did not cease to pollute with their sins the world and its rich treasures, He would blot them from His creation, and would destroy the things with which He had delighted to bless them; He would sweep away the beasts of the field, and the vegetation which furnished such an abundant supply of food, and would transform the fair earth into one vast scene of desolation and ruin.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 92}
