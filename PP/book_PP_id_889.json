{"word": "God delivered Israel with the mighty manifestations of His power, and with judgments upon all the gods of Egypt. \"He brought forth his people with joy, and His chosen with gladness: . . . that they might observe His statutes, and keep His laws.\" Psalm 105:43-45. He rescued them from their servile state, that He might bring them to a good land--a land which in His providence had been prepared for them as a refuge from their enemies, where they might dwell under the shadow of His wings. He would bring them to Himself, and encircle them in His everlasting arms; and in return for all His goodness and mercy to them they were required to have no other gods before Him, the living God, and to exalt His name and make it glorious in the earth.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 334}
