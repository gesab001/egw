{"word": "But Moses discerned ground for hope where there appeared only discouragement and wrath. The words of God, \"Let Me alone,\" he understood not to forbid but to encourage intercession, implying that nothing but the prayers of Moses could save Israel, but that if thus entreated, God would spare His people. He \"besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy people, which Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 318}
