{"word": "On the day following the engagement, the Philistines, searching the battlefield to rob the slain, discovered the bodies of Saul and his three sons. To complete their triumph, they cut off the head of Saul and stripped him of his armor; then the head and the armor, reeking with blood, were sent to the country of the Philistines as a trophy of victory, \"to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.\" The armor was finally put in \"the house of Ashtaroth,\" while the head was fastened in the temple of Dagon. Thus the glory of the victory was ascribed to the power of these false gods, and the name of Jehovah was dishonored.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 682}
