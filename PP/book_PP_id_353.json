{"word": "Seeing the abuse to which strangers were exposed in Sodom, Lot made it one of his duties to guard them at their entrance, by offering them entertainment at his own house. He was sitting at the gate as the travelers approached, and upon observing them, he rose from his place to meet them, and bowing courteously, said, \"Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night.\" They seemed to decline his hospitality, saying, \"Nay; but we will abide in the street.\" Their object in this answer was twofold--to test the sincerity of Lot and also to appear ignorant of the character of the men of Sodom, as if they supposed it safe to remain in the street at night. Their answer \n                                                                           159\nmade Lot the more determined not to leave them to the mercy of the rabble. He pressed his invitation until they yielded, and accompanied him to his house.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 158}
