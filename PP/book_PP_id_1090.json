He arose sorrowful indeed, but calm and strong. Divine guidance had been granted him. \"Even tomorrow,\" he said, \"the Lord will show who are His, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto Him: even him whom He hath chosen will He cause to come near unto Him.\" The test was to be deferred until the morrow, that all might have time for reflection.
