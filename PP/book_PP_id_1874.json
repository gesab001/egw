{"word": "On the first day of the feast the king made no inquiry concerning the absence of David; but when his place was vacant the second day, he questioned, \"Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday nor today? And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem: and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.\" When Saul heard these words, his anger was ungovernable. He declared that as long as David lived, Jonathan could not come to the throne of Israel, and he demanded that David should be sent for immediately, that he might be put to death. Jonathan again made intercession for his friend, pleading, \"Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?\" This appeal to the king only made him more satanic in his fury, and the spear which he had intended for David he now hurled at his own son.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 655}
