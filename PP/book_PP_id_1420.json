{"word": "Before the evening fell, God's promise to Joshua had been fulfilled. The entire host of the enemy had been given into his hand.

Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people.\" Habakkuk 3:11-13. \n                                                                           509", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 508}
