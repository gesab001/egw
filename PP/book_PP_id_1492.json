{"word": "In the days of Israel the tithe and freewill offerings were needed to maintain the ordinances of divine service. Should the people of God give less in this age? The principle laid down by Christ is that our offerings to God should be in proportion to the light and privileges enjoyed. \"Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required.\" Luke 12:48. Said the Saviour to His disciples as He sent them forth, \"Freely ye have received, freely give.\" Matthew 10:8. As our blessings and privileges are \n                                                                           529\nincreased--above all, as we have before us the unparalleled sacrifice of the glorious Son of God--should not our gratitude find expression in more abundant gifts to extend to others the message of salvation? The work of the gospel, as it widens, requires greater provision to sustain it than was called for anciently; and this makes the law of tithes and offerings of even more urgent necessity now than under the Hebrew economy. If His people were liberally to sustain His cause by their voluntary gifts, instead of resorting to unchristian and unhallowed methods to fill the treasury, God would be honored, and many more souls would be won to Christ.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 528}
