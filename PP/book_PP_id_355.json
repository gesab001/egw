{"word": "Knowing that if provoked to violence they could easily break into his house, Lot went out to try the effect of persuasion upon them. \"I pray you, brethren,\" he said, \"do not so wickedly,\" using the term \"brethren\" in the sense of neighbors, and hoping to conciliate them and make them ashamed of their vile purposes. But his words were like oil upon the flames. Their rage became like the roaring of a tempest. They mocked Lot as making himself a judge over them, and threatened to deal worse with him than they had purposed toward his guests. They rushed upon him, and would have torn him in pieces had he not been rescued by the angels of God. The heavenly messengers \"put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.\" The events that followed, revealed the character of the guests he had entertained. \"They smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\" Had they not been visited with double blindness, being given up to hardness of heart, the stroke of God upon them would have caused them to fear, and to desist from their evil work. That last night was marked by no greater sins than many others before it; but mercy, so long slighted, had at last ceased its pleading. The inhabitants of Sodom had passed the limits of divine forbearance--\"the hidden boundary between God's patience and His wrath.\" The fires of His vengeance were about to be kindled in the vale of Siddim.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 159}
