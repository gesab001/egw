{"word": "The great leader summoned his guilty brother and sternly demanded, \"What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?\" Aaron endeavored to shield himself by relating the clamors of the people; that if he had not complied with their wishes, he would have been put to death. \"Let not the anger of my lord wax hot,\" he said; \"thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.\" He would lead Moses to believe that a miracle had been wrought--that the gold had been cast into the fire, and by supernatural power changed to a calf. But his excuses and prevarications were of no avail. He was justly dealt with as the chief offender.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 320}
