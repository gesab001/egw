{"word": "Israel's sin at Beth-peor brought the judgments of God upon the nation, and though the same sins may not now be punished as speedily, they will as surely meet retribution. \"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.\" 1 Corinthians 3:17. Nature has affixed terrible penalties to these crimes--penalties which, sooner or later, will be inflicted upon every transgressor. It is these sins more than any other that have caused the fearful degeneracy of our race, and the weight of disease and misery with which the world is cursed. Men may succeed in concealing their transgression from their fellow men, but they will no less surely reap the result, in suffering, disease, imbecility, or death. And beyond this life stands the tribunal of the judgment, with its award of eternal penalties. \"They which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\" but with Satan and evil angels shall have their part in that \"lake of fire\" which \"is the second death.\" Galatians 5:21; Revelation 20:14.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 461}
