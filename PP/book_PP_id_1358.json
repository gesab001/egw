{"word": "Chap. 45 - The Fall of Jericho\n\n     The Hebrews had entered Canaan, but they had not subdued it; and to human appearance the struggle to gain possession of the land must be long and difficult. It was inhabited by a powerful race, who stood ready to oppose the invasion of their territory. The various tribes were bound together by the fear of a common danger. Their horses and iron battle chariots, their knowledge of the country, and their training in war, would give them great advantage. Furthermore, the country was guarded by fortresses--\"cities great and fenced up to heaven.\" Deuteronomy 9:1. Only in the assurance of a strength not their own could the Israelites hope for success in the impending conflict.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 487}
