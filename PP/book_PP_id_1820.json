{"word": "\"Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.\" Rebellion originated with Satan, and all rebellion against God is directly due to satanic influence. Those who set themselves against the government of God have entered into an alliance with the archapostate, and he will exercise his power and cunning to captivate the senses and mislead the understanding. He will cause everything to appear in a false light.
