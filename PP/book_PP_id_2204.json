{"word": "THE KINGDOM WAS THEN SUBJECT TO BABYLON. WHEN BABYLON FELL, AND MEDO-PERSIA SUCCEEDED, IT WAS OVERTURNED THE FIRST TIME. WHEN MEDO-PERSIA FELL AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY GREECE, IT WAS OVERTURNED THE SECOND TIME. WHEN THE GREEK EMPIRE GAVE WAY TO ROME, IT WAS OVERTURNED THE THIRD TIME. AND THEN SAYS THE WORD, \"IT SHALL BE NO MORE, UNTIL HE COME WHOSE RIGHT IT IS; AND I WILL GIVE IT HIM.\" WHO IS HE WHOSE RIGHT IT IS? \"THOU . . . SHALT CALL HIS NAME JESUS. HE SHALL BE GREAT, AND SHALL BE CALLED THE SON OF THE HIGHEST: AND THE LORD GOD SHALL GIVE UNTO HIM THE THRONE OF HIS FATHER DAVID: AND HE SHALL REIGN OVER THE HOUSE OF JACOB FOREVER; AND OF HIS KINGDOM THERE SHALL BE NO END.\" LUKE 1:31-33. AND WHILE HE WAS HERE AS \"THAT PROPHET,\" A MAN OF SORROWS AND ACQUAINTED WITH GRIEF, THE NIGHT IN WHICH HE WAS BETRAYED HE HIMSELF DECLARED, \"MY KINGDOM IS NOT OF THIS WORLD.\" THUS THE THRONE OF THE LORD HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS WORLD AND WILL \"BE NO MORE, UNTIL HE COME WHOSE RIGHT IT IS,\" AND THEN IT WILL BE GIVEN HIM. AND THAT TIME IS THE END OF THIS WORLD, AND THE BEGINNING OF \"THE WORLD TO COME.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 762}
