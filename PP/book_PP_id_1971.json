{"word": "Satan was determined to keep his hold on the land of Canaan, and when it was made the habitation of the children of Israel, and the law of God was made the law of the land, he hated Israel with a cruel and malignant hatred and plotted their destruction. \n                                                                           689\nThrough the agency of evil spirits strange gods were introduced; and because of transgression, the chosen people were finally scattered from the Land of Promise. This history Satan is striving to repeat in our day. God is leading His people out from the abominations of the world, that they may keep His law; and because of this, the rage of \"the accuser of our brethren\" knows no bounds. \"The devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\" Revelation 12:10, 12. The antitypical land of promise is just before us, and Satan is determined to destroy the people of God and cut them off from their inheritance. The admonition, \"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation\" (Mark 14:38), was never more needed than now.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 688}
