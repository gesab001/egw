{"word": "In his expedition against Amalek, Saul thought he had done all that was essential of that which the Lord had commanded him; but the Lord was not pleased with partial obedience, nor willing to pass over what had been neglected through so plausible a motive. God has given men no liberty to depart from His requirements. The Lord had declared to Israel, \"Ye shall not do . . . every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;\" but ye shall \"observe and hear all these words which I command thee.\" Deuteronomy 12:8, 28. In deciding upon any course of action we are not to ask whether we can see that harm will result from it, but whether it is in keeping with the will of God. \"There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; but the end thereof are the ways of death.\" Proverbs 14:12.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 634}
