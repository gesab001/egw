{"word": "God celebrated the first marriage. Thus the institution has for its originator the Creator of the universe. \"Marriage is honorable\" (Hebrews 13:4); it was one of the first gifts of God to man, and it is one of the two institutions that, after the Fall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates of Paradise. When the divine principles are recognized and obeyed in this relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the purity and happiness of the race, it provides for man's social needs, it elevates the physical, the intellectual, and the moral nature.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 46}
