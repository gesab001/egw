{"word": "When the divine Presence was manifested upon Sinai, the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire in the sight of all Israel. But when Christ shall come in glory with His holy angels the whole earth shall be ablaze with the terrible light of His presence. \"Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people.\" Psalm 50:3, 4. A fiery stream shall issue and come forth from before Him, which shall cause the elements to melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up. \"The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in \n                                                                           340\nflaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel.\" 2 Thessalonians 1:7, 8.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 339}
