{"word": "Ahithophel had been held in high esteem for his wisdom, but he was destitute of the enlightenment which comes from God. \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\" (Proverbs 9:10); and this, Ahithophel did not possess, or he could hardly have based the success of treason upon the crime of incest. Men of corrupt hearts plot wickedness, as if there were no overruling Providence to cross their designs; but \"He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.\" Psalm 2:4. The Lord declares: \"They would none of My counsel: they despised all My reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.\" Proverbs 1:30-32.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 739}
