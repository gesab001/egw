{"word": "Of David's sacred regard for human life, striking evidence had been given, even while he himself was hunted like a beast of prey. One day while he was hidden in the cave of Adullam, his thoughts turning back to the untroubled freedom of his boyhood life, the fugitive exclaimed, \"Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!\" 2 Samuel 23:13-17. Bethlehem was at that time in the hands of the Philistines; but three mighty men of David's band broke through the guard, and brought of the water of Bethlehem to their master. David could not drink it. \"Be it far from me,\" he \n                                                                           737\ncried; \"is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?\" And he reverently poured out the water as an offering to God. David had been a man of war, much of his life had been spent amid scenes of violence; but of all who have passed through such an ordeal, few indeed have been so little affected by its hardening, demoralizing influence as was David.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 736}
