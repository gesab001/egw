{"word": "God is the foundation of everything. All true science is in harmony with His works; all true education leads to obedience to His government. Science opens new wonders to our view; she soars high, and explores new depths; but she brings nothing from her research that conflicts with divine revelation. Ignorance may seek to support false views of God by appeals to science, but the book of nature and the written word shed light upon each other. \n                                                                           116\nWe are thus led to adore the Creator and to have an intelligent trust in His word.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 115}
