Some would listen and believe. Others, looking at the circumstances that surrounded them, refused to hope. The Egyptians, being informed of what was reported among their bondmen, derided their expectations and scornfully denied the power of their God. They pointed to their situation as a nation of slaves, and tauntingly said, \"If your God is just and merciful, and possesses power above that of the Egyptian gods, why does He not make you a free people?\" They called attention to their own condition. They worshiped deities \n                                                                           260\ntermed by the Israelites false gods, yet they were a rich and powerful nation. They declared that their gods had blessed them with prosperity, and had given them the Israelites as servants, and they gloried in their power to oppress and destroy the worshipers of Jehovah. Pharaoh himself boasted that the God of the Hebrews could not deliver them from his hand.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 259}
