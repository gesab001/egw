{"word": "\"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which He commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever.

And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 621}
