{"word": "And the fifty-first psalm is an expression of David's repentance, when the message of reproof came to him from God: \n\n\n          \"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy loving-kindness: \n           According unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out \n               my transgressions. \n                                                                           725\n\n           Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from \n               my sin. \n           For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before \n               me. . . . \n           Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I \n               shall be whiter than snow. \n           Make me to hear joy and gladness; \n           That the bones which Thou hast broken may rejoice. \n           Hide Thy face from my sins, \n           And blot out all mine iniquities. \n           Create in me a clean heart, O God; \n           And renew a right spirit within me. \n           Cast me not away from Thy presence; \n           And take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. \n           Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation; \n           And uphold me with Thy free Spirit. \n           Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways; \n           And sinners shall be converted unto Thee. \n           Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my \n               salvation: \n           And my tongue shall sing aloud of Thy righteousness.\" \n                                                     Psalm 51:1-14.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 724}
