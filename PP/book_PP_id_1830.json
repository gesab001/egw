With surprise he questioned why the prophet and judge of Israel should desire to see him; but without delay he obeyed the call. \"Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to.\" As Samuel beheld with pleasure the handsome, manly, modest shepherd boy, the voice of the Lord spoke to the prophet, saying, \"Arise, anoint him: for this is he.\" David had proved himself brave and faithful in the humble office of a shepherd, and now God had chosen him to be captain of His people. \"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of [from among] his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward.\" The prophet had accomplished his appointed work, and with a relieved heart he returned to Ramah.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 641}
