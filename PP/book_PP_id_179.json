{"word": "It was not multitudes or majorities that were on the side of right. The world was arrayed against God's justice and His laws, and Noah was regarded as a fanatic. Satan, when tempting Eve to disobey God, said to her, \"Ye shall not surely die.\" Genesis 3:4. Great men, worldly, honored, and wise men, repeated the same. \"The threatenings of God,\" they said, \"are for the purpose of intimidating, and will never be verified. You need not be alarmed. Such an event as the destruction of the world by the God who made it, and the punishment of the beings He has created, will never take place. Be at peace; fear not. Noah is a wild fanatic.\" The world made merry at the folly of the deluded old man. Instead of humbling the heart before God, they continued their disobedience and wickedness, the same as though God had not spoken to them through His servant.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 96}
