{"word": "God has made men His stewards. The property which He has placed in their hands is the means that He has provided for the spread of the gospel. To those who prove themselves faithful stewards He will commit greater trusts. Saith the Lord, \"Them that honor Me I will honor.\" 1 Samuel 2:30. \"God loveth a cheerful giver,\" and when His people, with grateful hearts, bring their gifts and offerings to Him, \"not grudgingly, or of necessity,\" His blessing will attend them, as He has promised. \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\" Malachi 3:10.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 529}
