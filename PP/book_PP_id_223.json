{"word": "\"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.\" \"For He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.\" Psalm 33:6, 9. The Bible recognizes no long ages in which the earth was slowly evolved from chaos. Of each successive day of creation, the sacred record declares that it consisted of the evening and the morning, like all other days that have followed. At the close of each day is given the result of the Creator's work. The statement is made at the close of the first week's record, \"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created.\" Genesis 2:4. But this does not convey the idea that the days of creation were other than literal days. Each day was called a generation, because that in it God generated, or produced, some new portion of His work.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 112}
