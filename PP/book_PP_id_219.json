{"word": "Thus God will destroy the wicked from off the earth. But the righteous will be preserved in the midst of these commotions, as Noah was preserved in the ark. God will be their refuge, and under His wings shall they trust. Says the psalmist: \"Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee.\" Psalm 91:9, 10. \"In the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion: in the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me.\" Psalm 27:5. God's promise is, \"Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known My name.\" Psalm 91:14.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 110}
