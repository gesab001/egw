{"word": "But further evidence was given that the priesthood had been established in the family of Aaron. By divine direction each tribe prepared a rod and wrote upon it the name of the tribe. The name of Aaron was upon that of Levi. The rods were laid up in the tabernacle, \"before the testimony.\" The blossoming of any rod was to be a token that the Lord had chosen that tribe for the priesthood. On the morrow, \"behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.\" It was shown to the people, and afterward laid up in the tabernacle as a witness to succeeding generations. This miracle effectually settled the question of the priesthood.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 403}
