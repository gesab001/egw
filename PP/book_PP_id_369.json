{"word": "Before the destruction of Sodom, God sent a message to Lot, \"Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\" The same voice of warning was heard by the disciples of Christ before the destruction of Jerusalem: \"When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains.\" Luke 21:20, 21. They must not tarry to secure anything from their possessions, but must make the most of the opportunity to escape.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 166}
