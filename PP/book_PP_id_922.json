{"word": "While the building of the sanctuary was in progress the people, old and young--men, women, and children--continued to bring their offerings, until those in charge of the work found that they had enough, and even more than could be used. And Moses caused to be proclaimed throughout the camp, \"Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.\" The murmurings of the Israelites and the visitations of God's judgments because of their sins are recorded as a warning to after-generations. And their devotion, their zeal and liberality, are an example worthy of imitation. All who love the worship of God and prize the blessing of His sacred presence will manifest the same spirit of sacrifice in preparing a house where He may meet with them. They will desire to bring to the Lord an offering of the very best that they possess. A house built for God should not be left in debt, for He is thereby dishonored. An amount sufficient to accomplish the work should be freely given, that the workmen \n                                                                           347\nmay be able to say, as did the builders of the tabernacle, \"Bring no more offerings.\"", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 344}
