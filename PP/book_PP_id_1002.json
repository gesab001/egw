{"word": "God brought them to Sinai; He manifested His glory; He gave them His law, with the promise of great blessings on condition of obedience: \"If ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then . . . ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.\" Exodus 19:5, 6.

Feeling that they were able to establish their own righteousness, they declared, \"All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient.\" Exodus 24:7.
