{"word": "In stern and solemn words the prophet swept away the refuge of lies and pronounced the irrevocable sentence: \"Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, He hath also rejected thee from being king.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 631}
