{"word": "Balaam had given evidence of the spirit that controlled him, by his treatment of his beast. \"A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.\" \n                                                                           443\nProverbs 12:10. Few realize as they should the sinfulness of abusing animals or leaving them to suffer from neglect. He who created man made the lower animals also, and \"His tender mercies are over all His works.\" Psalm 145:9. The animals were created to serve man, but he has no right to cause them pain by harsh treatment or cruel exaction.", "paragraph": 5, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 442}
