{"word": "The Lord said unto him, \"Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord?\" To this was added another assurance of divine aid: \"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.\" But Moses still entreated that a more competent person be selected. These excuses at first proceeded from humility and diffidence; but after the Lord had promised to remove all difficulties, and to give him final success, then any further shrinking back and complaining of his unfitness showed distrust of God. It implied a fear that God was unable to qualify him for the great work to which He had called him, or that He had made a mistake in the selection of the man.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 254}
