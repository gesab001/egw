{"word": "The time is not far distant when God will arise to vindicate His insulted authority. \"The Lord cometh out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.\" Isaiah 26:21. \"But who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall stand when He appeareth?\" Malachi 3:2. The people of Israel, because of their sinfulness, were forbidden to approach the mount when God was about to descend upon it to proclaim His law, lest they should be consumed by the burning glory of His presence. If such manifestations of His power marked the place chosen for the proclamation of God's law, how terrible must be His tribunal when He comes for the execution of these sacred statutes. How will those who have trampled upon His authority endure His glory in the great day of final retribution? The terrors of Sinai were to represent to the people the scenes of the judgment. The sound of a trumpet summoned Israel to meet with God. The voice of the Archangel and the trump of God shall summon, from the whole earth, both the living and the dead to the presence of their Judge. The Father and the Son, attended by a multitude of angels, were present upon the mount. At the great judgment day Christ will come \"in the glory of His Father with His angels.\" Matthew 16:27. He shall then sit upon the throne of His glory, and before Him shall be gathered all nations.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 339}
