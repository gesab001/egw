{"word": "Though called a \"Cushite woman\" (Numbers 12:1, R.V.), the wife of Moses was a Midianite, and thus a descendant of Abraham. In personal appearance she differed from the Hebrews in being of a somewhat darker complexion. Though not an Israelite, Zipporah was a worshiper of the true God. She was of a timid, retiring disposition, gentle and affectionate, and greatly distressed at the sight of suffering; and it was for this reason that Moses, when on the way to Egypt, had consented to her return to Midian. \n                                                                           384\nHe desired to spare her the pain of witnessing the judgments that were to fall on the Egyptians.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 383}
