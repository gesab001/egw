{"word": "The forbearance that God has exercised toward the wicked, emboldens men in transgression; but their punishment will be none the less certain and terrible for being long delayed. \"The Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim, He shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that He may do His work, His strange work; and bring to pass His act, His strange act.\" Isaiah 28:21. To our merciful God the act of punishment is a strange act. \"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live.\" Ezekiel 33:11. The Lord is \"merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, . . . forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.\" Yet He will \"by no means clear the guilty.\" Exodus 34:6, 7. While He does not delight in vengeance, He will execute judgment upon the transgressors of His law. He is forced to do this, to preserve the inhabitants of the earth from utter depravity and ruin. In order to save some He must cut off those who have become hardened in sin. \"The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked.\" Nahum 1:3. By terrible things in righteousness He will vindicate the authority of His downtrodden law. And the very fact of His reluctance to execute justice testifies to the enormity of the sins that call forth His judgments and to the severity of the retribution awaiting the transgressor.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 628}
