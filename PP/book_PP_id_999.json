{"word": "Another compact--called in Scripture the \"old\" covenant--was formed between God and Israel at Sinai, and was then ratified by the blood of a sacrifice. The Abrahamic covenant was ratified by the blood of Christ, and it is called the \"second,\" or \"new,\" covenant, because the blood by which it was sealed was shed after the blood of the first covenant. That the new covenant was valid in the days of Abraham is evident from the fact that it was then confirmed both by the promise and by the oath of God--the \"two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie.\" Hebrews 6:18.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 371}
