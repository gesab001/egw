{"word": "The manna, falling from heaven for the sustenance of Israel, was a type of Him who came from God to give life to the world. Said Jesus, \"I am that Bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven. . . . If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" John 6:48-51. And among the promises of blessing to God's people in the future life it is written, \"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna.\" Revelation 2:17.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 297}
