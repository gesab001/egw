{"word": "Esau had lightly valued the blessing while it seemed within his reach, but he desired to possess it now that it was gone from him forever. All the strength of his impulsive, passionate nature was aroused, and his grief and rage were terrible. He cried with an exceeding bitter cry, \"Bless me, even me also, O my father!\" \"Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?\" But the promise given was not to be recalled. The birthright which he had so carelessly bartered he could not now regain. \"For one morsel of meat,\" for a momentary gratification of appetite that had never been restrained, Esau sold his inheritance; but when he saw his folly, it was too late to recover the blessing. \"He found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.\" Hebrews 12:16, 17. Esau was not shut out from the privilege of seeking God's favor by repentance, but he could find no means of recovering the birthright. His grief did not spring from conviction of sin; he did not desire to be reconciled to God. He sorrowed because of the results of his sin, but not for the sin itself.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 181}
