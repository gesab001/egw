{"word": "The tabernacle was so constructed that it could be taken apart and borne with the Israelites in all their journeyings. It was therefore small, being not more than fifty-five feet in length, and eighteen in breadth and height. Yet it was a magnificent structure. The wood employed for the building and its furniture was that of the acacia tree, which was less subject to decay than any other to be obtained at Sinai. The walls consisted of upright boards, set in silver sockets, and held firm by pillars and connecting bars; and all were overlaid with gold, giving to the building the appearance of solid gold. The roof was formed of four sets of curtains, the innermost of \"fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work;\" the other three respectively were of goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, so arranged as to afford complete protection.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 347}
