{"word": "True faith, which relies wholly upon Christ, will be manifested by obedience to all the requirements of God. From Adam's day to the present time the great controversy has been concerning obedience to God's law. In all ages there have been those who claimed a right to the favor of God even while they were disregarding some of His commands. But the Scriptures declare that by works is \"faith made perfect;\" and that, without the works of obedience, faith \"is dead.\" James 2:22, 17. He that professes to know God, \"and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" 1 John 2:4.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 73}
