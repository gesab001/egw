{"word": "The crowning blessings of the birthright were transferred to Judah. The significance of the name--which denotes praise,--is unfolded in the prophetic history of this tribe: \n\n\n     \"Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: \n      Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; \n      Thy father's children shall bow down before thee. \n      Judah is a lion's whelp: \n      From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: \n      He stooped down, he couched as a lion, \n      And as an old lion: who shall rouse him up? \n      The scepter shall not depart from Judah, \n      Nor a lawgiver from between his feet, \n      Until Shiloh come; \n      And unto Him shall the gathering of the people be.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 236}
