{"word": "Such was the end of them that devised mischief against God's people. Says the psalmist: \"The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.\" Psalm 9:15. \"For the Lord will not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance. But judgment shall return unto righteousness.\" When men \"gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,\" the Lord \"shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness.\" Psalm 94:14, 15, 21, 23. \n                                                                           457", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 456}
