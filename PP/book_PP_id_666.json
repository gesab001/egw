Those signs and wonders were designed to convince Pharaoh that the great \"I AM\" had sent Moses, and that it was the duty of the king to let Israel go, that they might serve the living God. The magicians also showed signs and wonders; for they wrought not by their own skill alone, but by the power of their god, Satan, who assisted them in counterfeiting the work of Jehovah.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 264}
