And His providence still supplied their wants. \"The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand,\" said Moses, in rehearsing the history of their wanderings. \"He knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness; these forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.\" And the Levites' hymn, recorded by Nehemiah, vividly pictures God's care for Israel, even during these years of rejection and banishment: \"Thou in Thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go. Thou gavest also Thy \n                                                                           407\ngood Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not Thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. Yea, forty years didst Thou sustain them in the wilderness; . . . their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.\" Nehemiah 9:19-21.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 406}
