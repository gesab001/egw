{"word": "THE STATEMENT IN EXODUS 12:40, THAT \"THE SOJOURNING OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, WHO DWELT IN EGYPT, WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS,\" GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE ISRAELITES, FROM JACOB'S ENTRY INTO EGYPT TO THE EXODUS, ACTUALLY SPENT 430 YEARS IN THE COUNTRY OF THE NILE. THAT THIS IMPRESSION CANNOT BE CORRECT IS OBVIOUS FROM PAUL'S INSPIRED INTERPRETATION PRESENTED IN GALATIANS 3:16, 17, WHERE THE 430 YEARS ARE SAID TO COVER THE PERIOD BEGINNING WHEN GOD MADE HIS COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM UNTIL THE LAW WAS PROMULGATED AT SINAI. PAUL SEEMS TO REFER TO THE FIRST PROMISE MADE BY GOD TO ABRAHAM WHEN HE WAS CALLED TO LEAVE HARAN. GENESIS 12:1-3. AT THAT TIME THE 430 YEARS BEGAN, WHEN ABRAHAM WAS SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS OLD (CHAPTER 12:4), WHILE THE 400 YEARS OF THE PROPHECY OF GENESIS 15:13 BEGAN THIRTY YEARS LATER, WHEN ABRAHAM WAS 105 AND HIS SON ISAAC FIVE YEARS OLD (CHAPTER 21:5). AT THAT TIME ISHMAEL, WHO \"WAS BORN AFTER THE FLESH PERSECUTED HIM [ISAAC] THAT WAS BORN AFTER THE SPIRIT\" (GALATIANS 4:29; GENESIS 21:9-11), BEGINNING A TIME OF AFFLICTION OF ABRAHAM'S SEED WHICH INTERMITTENTLY WOULD BE CONTINUED UNTIL THE TIME OF THE EXODUS. ISAAC HAD NOT ONLY TROUBLES WITH HIS HALF BROTHER ISHMAEL, BUT ALSO WITH THE PHILISTINES (GENESIS 26:15, 20, 21); JACOB FLED FOR HIS LIFE FROM ESAU (GENESIS 27:41-43), AND LATER FROM LABAN (GENESIS 31:21), AND THEN WAS AGAIN IN JEOPARDY FROM ESAU (GENESIS 32:8); JOSEPH WAS SOLD INTO SLAVERY BY HIS BRETHREN (GENESIS 37:28), AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE OPPRESSED BY THE EGYPTIANS FOR MANY DECADES (EXODUS 1:14).", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 759}
