{"word": "Great was the indignation of the Israelites as they learned the deception that had been practiced upon them. And this was heightened when, after three days' journey, they reached the cities of the Gibeonites, near the center of the land. \"All the congregation murmured against the princes;\" but the latter refused to break the treaty, though secured by fraud, because they had \"sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel.\" \"And the children of Israel smote them not.\" The Gibeonites had pledged themselves to renounce idolatry, and accept the worship of Jehovah; and the preservation of their lives was not a violation of God's command to destroy the idolatrous Canaanites. Hence the Hebrews had not by their oath pledged themselves to commit sin. And though the oath had been secured by deception, it was not to be disregarded. The obligation to which one's word is pledged--if it do not bind him to perform a wrong act--should be held sacred. No consideration of gain, of revenge, or of self-interest can in any way affect the inviolability of an oath or pledge. \"Lying lips are abomination to the Lord.\" Proverbs 12:22. He that \"shall ascend into the hill of the Lord,\" and \"stand in His holy place,\" is \"he that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.\" Psalm 24:3; 15:4.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 506}
