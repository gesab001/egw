{"word": "\"The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians.\" The mysterious cloud changed to a pillar of fire before their astonished eyes. The thunders pealed and the lightnings flashed. \"The clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad. The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightning lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.\" Psalm 77:17, 18, R.V.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 287}
