{"word": "The example of those who minister in holy things should be such as to impress the people with reverence for God and with fear to offend Him. When men, standing \"in Christ's stead\" (2 Corinthians 5:20) to speak to the people God's message of mercy and reconciliation, use their sacred calling as a cloak for selfish or sensual gratification, they make themselves the most effective agents of Satan. Like Hophni and Phinehas, they cause men to \"abhor the offering of the Lord.\" They may pursue their evil course in secret for a time; but when at last their true character is exposed, the faith of the people receives a shock that often results in destroying their confidence in religion. There is left upon the mind a distrust of all who profess to teach the word of God. The message of the true servant of Christ is doubtfully received. The question constantly arises, \"Will not this man prove to be like the one we thought so holy, and found so corrupt?\" Thus the word of God loses its power upon the souls of men.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 580}
