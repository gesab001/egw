{"word": "\"The child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the Lord, and also with men.\" Though Samuel's youth was passed at the tabernacle devoted to the worship of God, he was not free from evil influences or sinful example. The sons of Eli feared not God, nor honored their father; but Samuel did not seek their company nor follow their evil ways. It was his constant endeavor to become what God would have him. This is the privilege of every youth. God is pleased when even little children give themselves to His service.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 573}
