{"word": "The life of Joseph illustrates the life of Christ. It was envy that moved the brothers of Joseph to sell him as a slave; they hoped to prevent him from becoming greater than themselves. And when he was carried to Egypt, they flattered themselves that they were to be no more troubled with his dreams, that they had removed all possibility of their fulfillment. But their own course was overruled by God to bring about the very event that they designed to hinder.

They put Him to death, to prevent Him from becoming king, but they were thus bringing about this very result.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 239}
