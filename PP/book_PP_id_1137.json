He was the source of all temporal as well as spiritual blessings. Christ, the true Rock, was with them in all their wanderings. \"They thirsted not when He led them through the deserts: He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.\" \"They ran in the dry places like a river.\" Isaiah 48:21; Psalm 105:41.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 411}
