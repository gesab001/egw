{"word": "It was to impress Abraham's mind with the reality of the gospel, as well as to test his faith, that God commanded him to slay his son. The agony which he endured during the dark days of that fearful trial was permitted that he might understand from his own experience something of the greatness of the sacrifice made by the infinite God for man's redemption. No other test could have caused Abraham such torture of soul as did the offering of his son. God gave His Son to a death of agony and shame. The angels who witnessed the humiliation and soul anguish of the Son of God were not permitted to interpose, as in the case of Isaac. There was no voice to cry, \"It is enough.\" To save the fallen race, the King of glory yielded up His life. What stronger proof can be given of the infinite compassion and love of God? \"He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\" Romans 8:32.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 154}
