{"word": "God works by the manifestation of His Spirit to reprove and convict the sinner; and if the Spirit's work is finally rejected, there is no more that God can do for the soul. The last resource of divine mercy has been employed. The transgressor has cut himself off from God, and sin has no remedy to cure itself. There is no reserved power by which God can work to convict and convert the sinner. \"Let him alone\" (Hosea 4:17) is the divine command. Then \"there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.\" Hebrews 10:26, 27.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 405}
