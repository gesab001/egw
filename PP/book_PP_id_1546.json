{"word": "\"They forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt,\" \"and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\" \"They provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.\" Therefore the Lord \"forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He placed among them; and delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemy's hand.\" Judges 2:12; Psalm 78:52, 58, 60, 61. Yet He did not utterly forsake His people. There was ever a remnant who were true to Jehovah; and from time to time the Lord raised up faithful and valiant men to put down idolatry and to deliver the Israelites from their enemies. But when the deliverer was dead, and the people were released from his authority, they would gradually return to their idols. And thus the story of backsliding and chastisement, of confession and deliverance, was repeated again and again.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 545}
