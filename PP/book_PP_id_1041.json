{"word": "Moses felt the importance of the great work committed to him as no other man had ever felt it. He realized his own weakness, and he made God his counselor. Aaron esteemed himself more highly, and trusted less in God. He had failed when entrusted with responsibility, giving evidence of the weakness of his character by his base compliance in the matter of the idolatrous worship at Sinai. But Miriam and Aaron, blinded by jealousy and ambition, lost sight of this. Aaron had been highly honored by God in the appointment of his family to the sacred office of the priesthood; yet even this now added to the desire for self-exaltation. \"And they said, Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath He not spoken also by us?\" Regarding themselves as equally favored by God, they felt that they were entitled to the same position and authority.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 383}
