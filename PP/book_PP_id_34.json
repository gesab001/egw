{"word": "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and in character. Christ alone is \"the express image\" (Hebrews 1:3) of the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God and in perfect obedience to His will.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 45}
