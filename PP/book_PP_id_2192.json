{"word": "THE TIME FROM ABRAHAM'S CALL TO JACOB'S ENTRY INTO EGYPT WAS 215 YEARS, BEING THE TOTAL OF (1) TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LYING BETWEEN ABRAHAM'S CALL AND THE BIRTH OF ISAAC (GENESIS 12:4; 21:5), (2) SIXTY YEARS LYING \n                                                                           760\nBETWEEN ISAAC'S BIRTH AND JACOB'S BIRTH (GENESIS 25:26), AND (3) THE AGE OF JACOB AT THE TIME OF HIS MIGRATION INTO EGYPT (GENESIS 47:9). THIS LEAVES THE REMAINING 215 YEARS OF THE 430 AS THE ACTUAL TIME THE HEBREWS SPENT IN EGYPT. HENCE THE 430 YEARS OF EXODUS 12:40 INCLUDES THE SOJOURN OF THE PATRIARCHS IN CANAAN AS WELL AS THEIR STAY IN EGYPT. SINCE IN THE TIME OF MOSES, PALESTINE WAS PART OF THE EGYPTIAN EMPIRE, IT IS NOT STRANGE TO FIND AN AUTHOR OF THAT PERIOD INCLUDING CANAAN IN THE TERM \"EGYPT.\" THE TRANSLATORS OF THE SEPTUAGINT, KNOWING THAT THE 430 YEARS INCLUDED THE SOJOURN OF THE PATRIARCHS IN CANAAN, MADE THIS POINT CLEAR IN THEIR RENDERING OF THIS PASSAGE: \"AND THE SOJOURNING OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, WHILE THEY SOJOURNED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE LAND OF CANAAN, WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS.\" AN ADDITIONAL CORROBORATION OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE 430 YEARS GIVEN ABOVE IS FOUND IN THE PROPHECY THAT THE FOURTH GENERATION OF THOSE WHO HAD ENTERED EGYPT WOULD LEAVE IT (GENESIS 15:16), AND ITS RECORDED FULFILLMENT IN EXODUS 6:16-20.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "PP", "page": 759}
