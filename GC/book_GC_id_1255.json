    "word": "True sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his letter to the Thessalonian church, declares: \"This is the will of God, even your sanctification.\" And he prays: \"The very God of peace sanctify you wholly.\" 1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23. The Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is and how it is to be attained. The Saviour prayed for His disciples: \"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.\" John 17:17. And Paul teaches that believers are to be \"sanctified by the Holy Ghost.\" Romans 15:16. What is the work of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples: \"When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.\" John 16:13. And the psalmist says: \"Thy law is the truth.\" By the word and the Spirit of God are opened to men the great principles of righteousness embodied in His law. And since the law of God is \"holy, and just, and good,\" a transcript of the divine perfection, it follows that a character formed by obedience to that law will be holy. Christ is a perfect example of such a character. He says: \"I have kept My Father's commandments.\" \"I do always those things that please Him.\" John 15:10;  8:29. The followers of Christ are to become like Him--by the grace of God to form characters in harmony with the principles of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification.",
