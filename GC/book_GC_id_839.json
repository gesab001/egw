    "word": "Christ had bidden His people watch for the signs of His advent and rejoice as they should behold the tokens of their coming King. \"When these things begin to come to pass,\" He said, \"then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.\" He pointed His followers to the budding trees of spring, and said: \"When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.\" Luke 21:28, 30, 31.",
