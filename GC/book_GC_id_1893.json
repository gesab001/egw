    "word": "\"NEITHER IS IT TO BE OBJECTED, AS I CONCEIVE, TO YOURSELF OR YOUR FRIENDS, THAT YOU HAVE DEVOTED MUCH TIME AND ATTENTION TO THE STUDY OF THE CHRONOLOGY OF PROPHECY, AND HAVE LABORED MUCH TO DETERMINE THE COMMENCING AND CLOSING DATES OF ITS GREAT PERIODS. IF THESE PERIODS ARE ACTUALLY GIVEN BY THE HOLY GHOST IN THE PROPHETIC BOOKS, IT WAS DOUBTLESS WITH THE DESIGN THAT THEY SHOULD BE STUDIED, AND PROBABLY, IN THE END, FULLY UNDERSTOOD; AND NO MAN IS TO BE CHARGED WITH PRESUMPTUOUS FOLLY WHO REVERENTLY MAKES THE ATTEMPT TO DO THIS. . . . IN TAKING A DAY AS THE PROPHETICAL TERM FOR A YEAR, I BELIEVE YOU ARE SUSTAINED BY THE SOUNDEST EXEGESIS, AS WELL AS FORTIFIED BY THE HIGH NAMES OF [JOSEPH] MEDE, SIR ISAAC NEWTON, BISHOP [THOMAS] NEWTON, [WILLIAM] KIRBY, [JAMES] SCOTT, [ALEXANDER] KEITH, AND A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAVE LONG SINCE COME TO SUBSTANTIALLY YOUR CONCLUSIONS ON THIS HEAD. THEY ALL AGREE THAT THE LEADING PERIODS MENTIONED BY DANIEL AND JOHN, DO ACTUALLY EXPIRE ABOUT THIS AGE OF THE WORLD, AND IT WOULD BE A STRANGE LOGIC THAT WOULD CONVICT YOU OF HERESY FOR HOLDING IN EFFECT THE SAME VIEWS WHICH STAND FORTH SO PROMINENT IN THE NOTICES OF THESE EMINENT DIVINES.\" \"YOUR RESULTS IN THIS FIELD OF INQUIRY DO NOT STRIKE ME SO FAR OUT OF THE WAY AS TO AFFECT ANY OF THE GREAT INTERESTS OF TRUTH OR DUTY.\" \"YOUR ERROR, AS I APPREHEND, LIES IN ANOTHER DIRECTION THAN YOUR CHRONOLOGY.\" \"YOU HAVE ENTIRELY MISTAKEN THE NATURE OF THE EVENTS WHICH ARE TO OCCUR WHEN THOSE PERIODS HAVE EXPIRED. THIS IS THE HEAD AND FRONT OF YOUR EXPOSITORY OFFENDING.\" SEE ALSO LEROY EDWIN FROOM, PROPHETIC FAITH OF OUR FATHERS (WASHINGTON, D.C.: REVIEW AND HERALD PUBLISHING ASSN., 1950), VOL. 1, CHS. 1, 2.",
