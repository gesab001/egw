    "word": "When Rome at one time determined to exterminate the hated sect, a bull was issued by the pope, condemning them as heretics, and delivering them to slaughter. (See Appendix.) They were not accused as idlers, or dishonest, or disorderly; but it was declared that they had an appearance of piety and sanctity that seduced \"the sheep of the true fold.\" Therefore the pope ordered \"that malicious and abominable sect of malignants,\" if they \"refuse to abjure, to be crushed like venomous snakes.\"--Wylie, b. 16, ch. 1.

Did he know that they were registered in the books of heaven, to confront him at the judgment? \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren,\" said Jesus, \"ye have done it unto Me.\" Matthew 25:40.",
