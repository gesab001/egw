On being urged to recant, one answered: \"I only believe in what the prophets and the apostles formerly preached, and what all the company of saints believed. My faith has a confidence in God which will resist all the powers of hell.\"--D'Aubigne, History of the Reformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin, b. 4, ch. 12.",
