    "word": "The angel had been sent to Daniel for the express purpose of explaining to him the point which he had failed to understand in the vision of the eighth chapter, the statement relative to time--\"unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\" After bidding Daniel \"understand the matter, and consider the vision,\" the very first words of the angel are: \"Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City.\" The word here translated \"determined\" literally signifies \"cut off.\" Seventy weeks, representing 490 years, are declared by the angel to be cut off, as specially pertaining to the Jews. But from what were they cut off? As the 2300 days was the only period of time mentioned in chapter 8, it must be the period from which the seventy weeks were cut off; the seventy weeks must therefore be a part of the 2300 days, and the two periods must begin together. The seventy weeks were declared by the angel to date from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem. If the date of this commandment could be found, then the starting point for the great period of the 2300 days would be ascertained.",
