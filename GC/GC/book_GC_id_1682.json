    "word": "Yet to human sight it will appear that the people of God must soon seal their testimony with their blood as did the martyrs before them. They themselves begin to fear that the Lord has left them to fall by the hand of their enemies. It is a time of fearful agony. Day and night they cry unto God for deliverance. The wicked exult, and the jeering cry is heard: \"Where now is your faith? Why does not God deliver you out of our hands if you are indeed His people?\" But the waiting ones remember Jesus dying upon Calvary's cross and the chief priests and rulers shouting in mockery: \"He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.\" Matthew 27:42. Like Jacob, all are wrestling with God. Their countenances express their internal struggle. Paleness sits upon every face. Yet they cease not their earnest intercession.",
