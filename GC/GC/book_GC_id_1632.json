    "word": "The work will be similar to that of the Day of Pentecost. As the \"former rain\" was given, in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing of the precious seed, so the \"latter rain\" will be given at its close for the ripening of the harvest. \"Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: His going forth is prepared as the morning; and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.\" Hosea 6:3. \"Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for He hath given you the former rain moderately, and He will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain.\" Joel 2:23. \"In the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh.\" \"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Acts 2:17, 21.",
