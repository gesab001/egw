    "word": "Both the prophecy of Daniel 8:14, \"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed,\" and the first angel's message, \"Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come,\" pointed to Christ's ministration in the most holy place, to the investigative judgment, and not to the coming of Christ for the redemption of His people and the destruction of the wicked. The mistake had not been in the reckoning of the prophetic periods, but in the event to take place at the end of the 2300 days. Through this error the believers had suffered disappointment, yet all that was foretold by the prophecy, and all that they had any Scripture warrant to expect, had been accomplished. At the very time when they were lamenting the failure of their hopes, the event had taken place which was foretold by the message, and which must be fulfilled before the Lord could appear to give reward to His servants.",
