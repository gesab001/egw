    "word": "The Spirit was not given--nor can it ever be bestowed--to supersede the Bible; for the Scriptures explicitly state that the word of God is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. Says the apostle John, \"Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.\" 1 John 4:1.
