    "word": "Before His presence \"all faces are turned into paleness;\" upon the rejecters of God's mercy falls the terror of eternal despair. \"The heart melteth, and the knees smite together, . . . and the faces of them all gather blackness.\" Jeremiah 30:6; Nahum 2:10. The righteous cry with trembling: \"Who shall be able to stand?\" The angels' song is hushed, and there is a period of awful silence. Then the voice of Jesus is heard, saying: \"My grace is sufficient for you.\" The faces of the righteous are lighted up, and joy fills every heart. And the angels strike a note higher and sing again as they draw still nearer to the earth.",
