    "word": "It was needful that men should be awakened to their danger; that they should be roused to prepare for the solemn events connected with the close of probation. The prophet of God declares: \"The day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?\" Who shall stand when He appeareth who is \"of purer eyes than to behold evil,\" and cannot \"look on iniquity\"? Joel 2:11; Habakkuk 1:13. To them that cry, \"My God, we know Thee,\" yet have transgressed His covenant, and hastened after another god, hiding iniquity in their hearts, and loving the paths of unrighteousness-- to these the day of the Lord is \"darkness, and not light, even very dark, and no brightness in it.\" Hosea 8:2, 1; Psalm 16:4; Amos 5:20. \"It shall come to pass at that time,\" saith the Lord, \"that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will He do evil.\" Zephaniah 1:12. \"I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.\" Isaiah 13:11. \"Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them;\" \"their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation.\" Zephaniah 1:18, 13.",
