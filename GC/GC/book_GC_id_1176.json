    "word": "What nation of the New World was in 1798 rising into power, giving promise of strength and greatness, and attracting the attention of the world? The application of the symbol admits of no question. One nation, and only one, meets the specifications of this prophecy; it points unmistakably to the United States of America. Again and again the thought, almost the exact words, of the sacred writer has been unconsciously employed by the orator and the historian in describing the rise and growth of this nation. The beast was seen \"coming up out of the earth;\" and, according to the translators, the word here rendered \"coming up\" literally signifies \"to grow or spring up as a plant.\" And, as we have seen, the nation must arise in territory previously unoccupied. A prominent writer, describing the rise of the United States, speaks of \"the mystery of her coming forth from vacancy,\" and says: \"Like a silent seed we grew into empire.\"--G. A. Townsend, The New World Compared With the Old, page 462. A European journal in 1850 spoke of the United States as a wonderful empire, which was \"emerging,\" and \"amid the silence of the earth daily adding to its power and pride.\" --The Dublin Nation. Edward Everett, in an oration on the Pilgrim founders of this nation, said: \"Did they look for a retired spot, inoffensive for its obscurity, and safe in its remoteness, where the little church of Leyden might enjoy the freedom of conscience? Behold the mighty regions over which, in peaceful conquest, . . . they have borne the banners of the cross!\"--Speech delivered at Plymouth, Massachusetts, Dec. 22, 1824, page 11.",
