    "word": "\"IMAGES AND PICTURES WERE FIRST INTRODUCED INTO CHURCHES, NOT TO BE WORSHIPED, BUT EITHER IN THE PLACE OF BOOKS TO GIVE INSTRUCTION TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT READ, OR TO EXCITE DEVOTION IN THE MINDS OF OTHERS. HOW FAR THEY EVER ANSWERED SUCH A PURPOSE IS DOUBTFUL; BUT, EVEN GRANTING THAT THIS WAS THE CASE FOR A TIME, IT SOON CEASED TO BE SO, AND IT WAS FOUND THAT PICTURES AND IMAGES BROUGHT INTO CHURCHES DARKENED RATHER THAN ENLIGHTENED THE MINDS OF THE IGNORANT--DEGRADED RATHER THAN EXALTED THE DEVOTION OF THE WORSHIPER. SO THAT, HOWEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO DIRECT MEN'S MINDS TO GOD, THEY ENDED IN TURNING THEM FROM HIM TO THE WORSHIP OF CREATED THINGS.\"--J.
