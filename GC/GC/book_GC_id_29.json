    "word": "Although Israel had \"mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and misused His prophets\" (2 Chronicles 36:16), He had still manifested Himself to them, as \"the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth\" (Exodus 34:6); notwithstanding repeated rejections, His mercy had continued its pleadings. With more than a father's pitying love for the son of his care, God had \"sent to them by His messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because He had compassion on His people, and on His dwelling place.\" 2 Chronicles 36:15. When remonstrance, entreaty, and rebuke had failed, He sent to them the best gift of heaven; nay, He poured out all heaven in that one Gift.",
