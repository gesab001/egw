    "word": "Said the prophets of old, as they beheld in holy vision the day of God: \"Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.\" Isaiah 13:6. \"Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon everyone that is proud and lofty, and upon everyone that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low.\" \"In that day a man shall cast the idols of his silver, and the idols of his gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty, when He ariseth to shake terribly the earth.\" Isaiah 2:10-12, 20, 21, margin.",
