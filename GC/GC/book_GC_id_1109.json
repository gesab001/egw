The Lord directed him: \"According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.\" And again the charge was given, \"Look that thou make them after their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount.\" Exodus 25:9, 40. And Paul says that the first tabernacle \"was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices;\" that its holy places were \"patterns of things in the heavens;\" that the priests who offered gifts according to the law served \"unto the example and shadow of heavenly things,\" and that \"Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.\" Hebrews 9:9, 23; 8:5; 9:24.",
