    "word": "The feelings of those who still believed that God had led them in their past experience are expressed in the words of William Miller: \"Were I to live my life over again, with the same evidence that I then had, to be honest with God and man I should have to do as I have done.\" \"I hope that I have cleansed my garments from the blood of souls. I feel that, as far as it was in my power, I have freed myself from all guilt in their condemnation.\" \"Although I have been twice disappointed,\" wrote this man of God, \"I am not yet cast down or discouraged. . . . My hope in the coming of Christ is as strong as ever. I have done only what, after years of solemn consideration, I felt it my solemn duty to do. If I have erred, it has been on the side of charity, love to my fellow men, and conviction of duty to God.\" \"One thing I do know, I have preached nothing but what I believed; and God has been with me; His power has been manifested in the work, and much good has been effected.\" \"Many thousands, to all human appearance, have been made to study the Scriptures by the preaching of the time; and by that means, through faith and the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, have been reconciled to God.\" --Bliss, pages 256, 255, 277, 280, 281. \"I have never courted the smiles of the proud, nor quailed when the world frowned. I shall not now purchase their favor, nor shall I go beyond duty to tempt their hate. I shall never seek my life at their hands, nor shrink, I hope, from losing it, if God in His good providence so orders.\" --J. White, Life of Wm. Miller, page 315.",
