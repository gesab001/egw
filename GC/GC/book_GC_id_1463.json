    "word": "\"The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" Romans 6:23. While life is the inheritance of the righteous, death is the portion of the wicked. Moses declared to Israel: \"I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.\" Deuteronomy 30:15.

It is \"the second death\" that is placed in contrast with everlasting life.",
