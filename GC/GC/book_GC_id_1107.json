    "word": "Turning again to the book of Hebrews, the seekers for truth found that the existence of a second, or new-covenant sanctuary, was implied in the words of Paul already quoted: \"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.\" And the use of the word \"also\" intimates that Paul has before made mention of this sanctuary. Turning back to the beginning of the previous chapter, they read: \"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a Minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.\" Hebrews 8:1, 2.",
