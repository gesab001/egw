    "word": "PAGE 373. ASCENSION ROBES.--THE STORY THAT THE ADVENTISTS MADE ROBES WITH WHICH TO ASCEND \"TO MEET THE LORD IN THE AIR,\" WAS INVENTED BY THOSE WHO WISHED TO REPROACH THE ADVENT PREACHING. IT WAS CIRCULATED SO INDUSTRIOUSLY THAT MANY BELIEVED IT, BUT CAREFUL INQUIRY PROVED ITS FALSITY. FOR MANY YEARS A SUBSTANTIAL REWARD WAS OFFERED FOR PROOF THAT ONE SUCH INSTANCE EVER OCCURRED, BUT NO PROOF HAS BEEN PRODUCED. NONE WHO LOVED THE APPEARING OF THE SAVIOUR WERE SO IGNORANT OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE SCRIPTURES AS TO SUPPOSE THAT ROBES WHICH THEY COULD MAKE WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THAT OCCASION. THE ONLY ROBE WHICH THE SAINTS WILL NEED TO MEET THE LORD IS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST. SEE ISAIAH 61:10; REVELATION 19:8.",
