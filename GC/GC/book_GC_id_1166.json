    "word": "By the first angel, men are called upon to \"fear God, and give glory to Him\" and to worship Him as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. In order to do this, they must obey His law. Says the wise man: \"Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.\" Ecclesiastes 12:13. Without obedience to His commandments no worship can be pleasing to God. \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\" \"He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.\" 1 John 5:3; Proverbs 28:9.",
