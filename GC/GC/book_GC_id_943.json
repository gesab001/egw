    "word": "So the throne of glory represents the kingdom of glory; and this kingdom is referred to in the Saviour's words: \"When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations.\" Matthew 25:31, 32.
