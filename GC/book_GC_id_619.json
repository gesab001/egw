    "word": "As a part of the services of the day the monarch himself addressed the high officials of the kingdom in the great hall of the bishop's palace. With a sorrowful countenance he appeared before them and in words of moving eloquence bewailed \"the crime, the blasphemy, the day of sorrow and disgrace,\" that had come upon the nation. And he called upon every loyal subject to aid in the extirpation of the pestilent heresy that threatened France with ruin. \"As true, messieurs, as I am your king,\" he said, \"if I knew one of my own limbs spotted or infected with this detestable rottenness, I would give it you to cut off. . . . And further, if I saw one of my children defiled by it, I would not spare him. . . . I would deliver him up myself, and would sacrifice him to God.\" Tears choked his utterance, and the whole assembly wept, with one accord exclaiming: \"We will live and die for the Catholic religion!\"--D'Aubigne, History of the Reformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin, b. 4, ch. 12.",
