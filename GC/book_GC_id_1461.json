    "word": "In sparing the life of Cain the murderer, God gave the world an example of what would be the result of permitting the sinner to live to continue a course of unbridled iniquity. Through the influence of Cain's teaching and example, multitudes of his descendants were led into sin, until \"the wickedness of man was great in the earth\" and \"every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\" \"The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.\" Genesis 6:5, 11.",
