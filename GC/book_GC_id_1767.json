    "word": "Every eye in that vast multitude is turned to behold the glory of the Son of God. With one voice the wicked hosts exclaim: \"Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord!\" It is not love to Jesus that inspires this utterance. The force of truth urges the words from unwilling lips. As the wicked went into their graves, so they come forth with the same enmity to Christ and the same spirit of rebellion. They are to have no new probation in which to remedy the defects of their past lives. Nothing would be gained by this. A lifetime of transgression has not softened their hearts. A second probation, were it given them, would be occupied as was the first in evading the requirements of God and exciting rebellion against Him.",
