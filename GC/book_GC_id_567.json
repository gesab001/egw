    "word": "To Melanchthon, who was crushed under the burden of anxiety and fear, he wrote: \"Grace and peace in Christ--in Christ, I say, and not in the world. Amen. I hate with exceeding hatred those extreme cares which consume you. If the cause is unjust, abandon it; if the cause is just, why should we belie the promises of Him who commands us to sleep without fear? . . . Christ will not be wanting to the work of justice and truth. He lives, He reigns; what fear, then, can we have?\"--Ibid., b. 14, ch. 6.",
