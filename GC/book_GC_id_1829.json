    "word": "PSEUDO-ISIDORE TOOK AS THE BASIS OF HIS FORGERIES A COLLECTION OF VALID CANONS CALLED THE HISPANA GALLICA AUGUSTODUNENSIS, THUS LESSENING THE DANGER OF DETECTION, SINCE COLLECTIONS OF CANONS WERE COMMONLY MADE BY ADDING NEW MATTER TO OLD. THUS HIS FORGERIES WERE LESS APPARENT WHEN INCORPORATED WITH GENUINE MATERIAL. THE FALSITY OF THE PSEUDO-ISIDORIAN FABRICATIONS IS NOW INCONTESTABLY ADMITTED, BEING PROVED BY INTERNAL EVIDENCE, INVESTIGATION OF THE SOURCES, THE METHODS USED, AND THE FACT THAT THIS MATERIAL WAS UNKNOWN BEFORE 852. HISTORIANS AGREE THAT 850 OR 851 IS THE MOST PROBABLE DATE FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE COLLECTION, SINCE THE DOCUMENT IS FIRST CITED IN THE ADMONITIO OF THE CAPITULARY OF QUIERCY, IN 857.",
