    "word": "During the persecution of Meaux, the teachers of the reformed faith were deprived of their license to preach, and they departed to other fields. Lefevre after a time made his way to Germany. Farel returned to his native town in eastern France, to spread the light in the home of his childhood. Already tidings had been received of what was going on at Meaux, and the truth, which he taught with fearless zeal, found listeners. Soon the authorities were roused to silence him, and he was banished from the city. Though he could no longer labor publicly, he traversed the plains and villages, teaching in private dwellings and in secluded meadows, and finding shelter in the forests and among the rocky caverns which had been his haunts in boyhood. God was preparing him for greater trials. \"The crosses, persecutions, and machinations of Satan, of which I was forewarned, have not been wanting,\" he said; \"they are even much severer than I could have borne of myself; but God is my Father; He has provided and always will provide me the strength which I require.\"--D'Aubigne, History of the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century, b. 12, ch. 9.",
