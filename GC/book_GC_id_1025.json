    "word": "In the Bible the sacred and enduring character of the relation that exists between Christ and His church is represented by the union of marriage. The Lord has joined His people to Himself by a solemn covenant, He promising to be their God, and they pledging themselves to be His and His alone. He declares: \"I will betroth thee unto Me forever; yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.\" Hosea 2:19. And, again: \"I am married unto you.\" Jeremiah 3:14. And Paul employs the same figure in the New Testament when he says: \"I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.\" 2 Corinthians 11:2.",
