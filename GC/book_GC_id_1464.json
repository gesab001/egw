    "word": "In consequence of Adam's sin, death passed upon the whole human race. All alike go down into the grave. And through the provisions of the plan of salvation, all are to be brought forth from their graves. \"There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust;\" \"for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" Acts 24:15; 1 Corinthians 15:22. But a distinction is made between the two classes that are brought forth. \"All that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\" John 5:28, 29. They who have been \"accounted worthy\" of the resurrection of life are \"blessed and holy.\" \"On such the second death hath no power.\" Revelation 20:6. But those who have not, through repentance and faith, secured pardon, must receive the penalty of transgression--\"the wages of sin.\" They suffer punishment varying in duration and intensity, \"according to their works,\" but finally ending in the second death. Since it is impossible for God, consistently with His justice and mercy, to save the sinner in his sins, He deprives him of the existence which his transgressions have forfeited and of which he has proved himself unworthy. Says an inspired writer: \"Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.\" And another declares: \"They shall be as though they had not been.\" Psalm 37:10; Obadiah 16. Covered with infamy, they sink into hopeless, eternal oblivion.",
