    "word": "These words faithfully described the corrupt and self-righteous inhabitants of Jerusalem. While claiming to observe rigidly the precepts of God's law, they were transgressing all its principles.

Though they knew Him to be sinless, they had declared that His death was necessary to their safety as a nation. \"If we let Him thus alone,\" said the Jewish leaders, \"all men will believe on Him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.\" John 11:48. If Christ were sacrificed, they might once more become a strong, united people.
