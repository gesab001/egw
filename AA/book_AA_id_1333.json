{"word": "When truth becomes an abiding principle in the life, the soul is \"born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.\" This new birth is the result of receiving Christ as the Word of God. When by the Holy Spirit divine truths are impressed upon the heart, new conceptions are awakened, and the energies hitherto dormant are aroused to co-operate with God.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 520}
