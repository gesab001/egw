{"word": "Chap. 30 - Called to Reach a Higher Standard\n\n     In the hope of impressing vividly upon the minds of the Corinthian believers the importance of firm self-control, strict temperance, and unflagging zeal in the service of Christ, Paul in his letter to them made a striking comparison between the Christian warfare and the celebrated foot races held at stated intervals near Corinth.

Young men of rank and wealth took part in them and shrank from no effort or discipline necessary to obtain the prize.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 309}
