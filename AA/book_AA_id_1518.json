{"word": "Upon the foundation that Christ Himself had laid, the apostles built the church of God. In the Scriptures the figure of the erection of a temple is frequently used to illustrate the building of the church. Zechariah refers to Christ as the Branch that should build the temple of the Lord. He speaks of the Gentiles as helping in the work: \"They that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the Lord;\" and Isaiah declares, \"The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls.\" Zechariah 6:12, 15; Isaiah 60:10.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 595}
