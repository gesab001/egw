{"word": "Paul well knew how his message would be regarded by both the Jews and the Greeks of Corinth. \"We preach Christ crucified,\" he admitted, \"unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness.\" 1 Corinthians 1:23. Among his Jewish hearers there were many who would be angered by the message he was about to proclaim. In the estimation of the Greeks his words would be absurd folly. He would be looked upon as weak-minded for attempting to show how the cross could have any connection with the elevation of the race or the salvation of mankind.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 245}
