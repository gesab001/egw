{"word": "In his second letter to the believers in Corinth, written after he had raised up a strong church there, Paul reviewed his manner of life among them. \"Have I committed an offense,\" he asked, \"in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service. And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself. As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.\" 2 Corinthians 11:7-10.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 350}
