{"word": "To Solomon, as one called to occupy a position of leading responsibility, David gave a special charge: \"Thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek Him, He will be found of thee; but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off forever. Take heed now; for the Lord hath chosen thee: . . . be strong.\" 1 Chronicles 28:9, 10.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 95}
