{"word": "For many years Peter had been urging upon the believers the necessity of a constant growth in grace and in a knowledge of the truth; and now, knowing that soon he would be called to suffer martyrdom for his faith, he once more drew attention to the precious privileges within the reach of every believer. In the full assurance of his faith the aged disciple exhorted his brethren to steadfastness of purpose in the Christian life. \"Give diligence,\" he pleaded, \"to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\" Precious assurance! Glorious is the hope before the believer as he advances by faith toward the heights of Christian perfection! \n                                                                           534", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 533}
