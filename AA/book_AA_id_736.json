{"word": "As was his custom, Paul had begun his work at Ephesus by preaching in the synagogue of the Jews. He continued to labor there for three months, \"disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.\" At first he met with a favorable reception; but as in other fields, he was soon violently opposed. \"Divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude.\" As they persisted in their rejection of the gospel, the apostle ceased to preach in the synagogue.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 285}
