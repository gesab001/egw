{"word": "Summoning a meeting of the believers, the apostles were led by the Holy Spirit to outline a plan for the better organization of all the working forces of the church. The time had come, the apostles stated, when the spiritual leaders having the oversight of the church should be relieved from the task of distributing to the poor and from similar burdens, so that they might be free to carry forward the work of preaching the gospel. \"Wherefore, brethren,\" they said, \"look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" This advice was followed, and by prayer and the laying on of hands, seven chosen men were solemnly set apart for their duties as deacons.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 89}
