{"word": "The God of heaven, the mighty Ruler of the universe, took the matter of the imprisonment of the disciples into His own hands, for men were warring against His work. By night \n                                                                           80\nthe angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and said to the disciples, \"Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.\" This command was directly contrary to the order given by the Jewish rulers; but did the apostles say, We cannot do this until we have consulted the magistrates and received permission from them? No; God had said, \"Go,\" and they obeyed. \"They entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 79}
