{"word": "The apostle's earnest words of entreaty were not fruitless. The Holy Spirit wrought with mighty power, and many whose feet had wandered into strange paths, returned to their former faith in the gospel. Henceforth they were steadfast in the liberty wherewith Christ had made them free. In their lives were revealed the fruits of the Spirit--\"love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\" The name of God was glorified, and many were added to the number of believers throughout that region.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 388}
