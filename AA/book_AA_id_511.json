{"word": "Journeying through Syria and Cilicia, where they strengthened the church, Paul and Silas at length reached Derbe and Lystra in the province of Lycaonia. It was at Lystra that Paul had been stoned, yet we find him again on the scene of his former danger.

He was not disappointed, for he found that the Lystrian believers had remained firm in the face of violent opposition.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 202}
