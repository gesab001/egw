{"word": "The solemn charge that had been given Paul on the occasion of his interview with Ananias, rested with increasing weight upon his heart. When, in response to the word, \"Brother Saul, receive thy sight,\" Paul had for the first time looked upon the face of this devout man, Ananias under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit said to him: \"The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know His will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of His mouth. For thou shalt be His witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard. And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.\" Acts 22:13-16.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 126}
