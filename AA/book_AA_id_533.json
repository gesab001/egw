{"word": "Through the cross we learn that the heavenly Father loves us with a love that is infinite. Can we wonder that Paul exclaimed, \"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ\"? Galatians 6:14. It is our privilege also to glory in the cross, our privilege to give ourselves wholly to Him who gave Himself for us. Then, with the light that streams from Calvary shining in our faces, we may go forth to reveal this light to those in darkness.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 210}
