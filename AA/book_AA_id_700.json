{"word": "It had been Paul's work to instruct the Corinthian converts in the rudiments, the very alphabet, of the Christian faith. He had been obliged to instruct them as those who were ignorant of the operations of divine power upon the heart. At that time they were unable to comprehend the mysteries of salvation; for \"the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they \n                                                                           272\nare spiritually discerned.\" Verse 14. Paul had endeavored to sow the seed, which others must water. Those who followed him must carry forward the work from the point where he had left it, giving spiritual light and knowledge in due season, as the church was able to bear it.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 271}
