{"word": "Cornelius was a Roman centurion. He was a man of wealth and noble birth, and his position was one of trust and honor. A heathen by birth, training, and education, through contact with the Jews he had gained a knowledge of God, and he worshiped Him with a true heart, showing the sincerity of his faith by compassion to the poor. He was known far and near for his beneficence, and his righteous life made him of good repute among both Jews and Gentiles. \n                                                                           133\nHis influence was a blessing to all with whom he came in contact. The inspired record describes him as \"a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 132}
