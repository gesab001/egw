{"word": "The tumult in the theater was continually increasing. \"Some . . . cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.\" The fact that Paul and some of his companions were of Hebrew extraction made the Jews anxious to show plainly that they were not sympathizers with him and his work. They therefore brought forward one of their own number to set the matter before the people. The speaker chosen was Alexander, one of the craftsmen, a coppersmith, to whom Paul afterward referred as having done him much evil. 2 Timothy 4:14. Alexander was a man of considerable ability, and he bent all his energies to direct the wrath of the people exclusively against Paul and his companions. But the crowd, seeing that Alexander was a Jew, thrust him aside, and \"all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 294}
