{"word": "\"Whereunto,\" asked Christ, \"shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?\" Mark 4:30. He could not employ the kingdoms of the world as a similitude. In society He found nothing with which to compare it. Earthly kingdoms rule by the ascendancy of physical power; but from Christ's kingdom every carnal weapon, every instrument of coercion, is banished. This kingdom is to uplift and ennoble humanity. God's church is the court of holy life, filled with varied gifts and endowed with the Holy Spirit. The members are to find their happiness in the happiness of those whom they help and bless. \n                                                                           13", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 12}
