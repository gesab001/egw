{"word": "Herod's act in putting James to death was applauded by the Jews, though some complained of the private manner in which it was accomplished, maintaining that a public execution would have more thoroughly intimidated the believers and those sympathizing  with them. Herod therefore held Peter in custody, meaning still further to gratify the Jews by the public spectacle of his death.

It was feared that the sight of him being led out to die might excite the pity of the multitude.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 144}
