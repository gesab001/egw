{"word": "True sanctification comes through the working out of the principle of love. \"God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\" 1 John 4:16. The life of him in whose heart Christ abides, will reveal practical godliness. The character will be purified, elevated, ennobled, and glorified. Pure doctrine will blend with works of righteousness; heavenly precepts will mingle with holy practices.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 560}
