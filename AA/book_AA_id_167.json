{"word": "From the stern punishment meted out to those perjurers, God would  have us learn also how deep is His hatred and contempt for all hypocrisy and deception. In pretending \n                                                                           76\nthat they had given all, Ananias and Sapphira lied to the Holy Spirit, and, as a result, they lost this life and the life that is to come. The same God who punished them, today condemns all falsehood. Lying lips are an abomination to Him. He declares that into the Holy City \"there shall in no wise enter . . . anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie.\" Revelation 21:27. Let truth telling be held with no loose hand or uncertain grasp. Let it become a part of the life. Playing fast and loose with truth, and dissembling to suit one's own selfish plans, means shipwreck of faith. \"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth.\" Ephesians 6:14. He who utters untruths sells his soul in a cheap market. His falsehoods may seem to serve in emergencies; he may thus seem to make business advancement that he could not gain by fair dealing; but he finally reaches the place where he can trust no one. Himself a falsifier, he has no confidence in the word of others.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 75}
