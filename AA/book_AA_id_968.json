{"word": "It is to this class that Isaiah referred in his prophecy, \"A remnant shall be saved.\" From Paul's day to the present time, God by His Holy Spirit has been calling after the Jew as well as the Gentile. \"There is no respect of persons with God,\" declared Paul. The apostle regarded himself as \"debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians,\" as well as to the Jews; but he never lost sight of the decided advantages possessed by the Jews over others, \"chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.\" \"The gospel,\" he declared, \"is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.\" It is of this gospel of Christ, equally efficacious for Jew and Gentile, that Paul in his epistle to the Romans declared he was not ashamed.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 380}
