{"word": "As Paul preached Christ in Damascus, all who heard him were amazed and said, \"Is not this he that destroyed \n                                                                           125\nthem which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?\" Paul declared that his change of faith had not been prompted by impulse or fanaticism, but had been brought about by overwhelming evidence. In his presentation of the gospel he sought to make plain the prophecies relating to the first advent of Christ. He showed conclusively that these prophecies had been literally fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth. The foundation of his faith was the sure word of prophecy.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 124}
