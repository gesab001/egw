{"word": "Filled with joy, the apostle sent another letter to the Corinthian believers, expressing his gladness of heart because of the good work wrought in them: \"Though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent.\" When tortured by the fear that his words would be despised, he had sometimes regretted that he had written so decidedly and severely. \"Now I rejoice,\" he continued, \"not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of.\" That repentance which is produced by the influence of divine grace upon the heart will lead to confession and forsaking of sin. Such were the fruits which the apostle declared had been seen in the lives of the Corinthian believers. \"What \n                                                                           325\ncarefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 324}
