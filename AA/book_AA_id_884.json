{"word": "God declares, \"Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters.\" Isaiah 32:20. A continual imparting of God's gifts wherever the cause of God or the needs of humanity demand our aid, does not tend to poverty. \"There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\" Proverbs 11:24. The sower multiplies his seed by casting it away. So it is with those who are faithful in distributing God's gifts. By imparting they increase their blessings. \"Give, and it shall be given unto you,\" God has promised; \"good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.\" Luke 6:38.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 345}
