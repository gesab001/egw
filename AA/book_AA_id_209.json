In his charge to these elders at the time of their ordination, he outlined some of the qualifications that fit a man to be a wise ruler in the church. \"Hear the causes between your brethren,\" said Moses, \"and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's.\" Deuteronomy 1:16, 17.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 94}
