{"word": "Chap. 45 - Written From Rome\n\n     The apostle Paul early in his Christian experience was given special opportunities to learn the will of God concerning the followers of Jesus. He was \"caught up to the third heaven,\" \"into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\" He himself acknowledged that many \"visions and revelations\" had been given him \"of the Lord.\" His understanding of the principles of gospel truth was equal to that of \"the very chiefest apostles.\" 2 Corinthians 12:2, 4, 1, 11. He had a clear, full comprehension of \"the breadth, and length, and depth, and height\" of \"the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.\" Ephesians 3:18, 19.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 469}
