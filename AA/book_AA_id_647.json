{"word": "The apostle's efforts were not confined to public speaking; there were many who could not have been reached in that way. He spent much time in house-to-house labor, thus availing himself of the familiar intercourse of the home circle. He visited the sick and the sorrowing, comforted the afflicted, and lifted up the oppressed. And in all that he said and did he magnified the name of Jesus. Thus he labored, \"in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.\" 1 Corinthians 2:3. He trembled lest his teaching should reveal the impress of the human rather than the divine.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 250}
