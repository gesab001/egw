{"word": "As in the typical service the high priest laid aside his pontifical robes and officiated in the white linen dress of an ordinary priest; so Christ laid aside His royal robes and garbed Himself with humanity and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. As the high priest, after performing his service in the holy of holies, came forth to the waiting congregation in his pontifical robes; so Christ will come the second time, clothed in garments of whitest white, \"so as no fuller on earth can white them.\" Mark 9:3. He will come in His own glory, and in the glory of His Father, and all the angelic host will escort Him on His way. \n                                                                           34", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 33}
