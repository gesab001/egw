{"word": "News of apostasy in some of the churches of his planting caused him deep sorrow. He feared that his efforts in their behalf might prove to be in vain. Many a sleepless night was spent in prayer and earnest thought as he learned of the methods employed to counteract his work. As he had opportunity and as their condition demanded, he wrote to the churches, giving reproof, counsel, admonition, and encouragement. In these letters the apostle does not dwell on his own trials, yet there are occasional glimpses of his labors and sufferings in the cause of Christ. Stripes and imprisonment, cold and hunger and thirst, perils by land and by sea, in the city and in the wilderness, from his own countrymen, from the heathen, and from false brethren--all this he endured for the sake of the gospel. He was \"defamed,\" \"reviled,\" made \"the offscouring of all things,\" \n                                                                           297\n\"perplexed,\" \"persecuted,\" \"troubled on every side,\" \"in jeopardy every hour,\" \"alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 296}
