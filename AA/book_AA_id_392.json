{"word": "The believers at Antioch realized that God was willing to work in their lives \"both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\" Philippians 2:13. Living, as they were, in the midst of a people who seemed to care but little for the things of eternal value, they sought to arrest the attention of the honest in heart, and to bear positive testimony concerning Him whom they loved and served.

And so, in the various walks of life, they daily bore testimony of their faith in Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 158}
