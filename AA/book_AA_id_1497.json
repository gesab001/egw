{"word": "The church was defective and in need of stern reproof and chastisement, and John was inspired to record messages of warning and reproof and entreaty to those who, losing sight of the fundamental principles of the gospel, should imperil their hope of salvation. But always the words of rebuke that God finds it necessary to send are spoken in tender love and with the promise of peace to every penitent believer. \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock,\" the Lord declares; \"if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.\" Revelation 3:20.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 587}
