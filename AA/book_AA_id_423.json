{"word": "After the departure of Mark, Paul and Barnabas visited Antioch in Pisidia and on the Sabbath day went into the Jewish synagogue and sat down. \"After the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto \n                                                                           171\nthem, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.\" Being thus invited to speak, \"Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.\" Then followed a wonderful discourse. He proceeded to give a history of the manner in which the Lord had dealt with the Jews from the time of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage, and how a Saviour had been promised, of the seed of David, and he boldly declared that \"of this man's seed hath God according to His promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: when John had first preached before His coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not He. But, behold, there cometh One after me, whose shoes of His feet I am not worthy to loose.\" Thus with power he preached Jesus as the Saviour of men, the Messiah of prophecy.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 170}
