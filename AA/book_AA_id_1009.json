{"word": "From Miletus the travelers sailed in \"a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara,\" on the southwest shore of Asia Minor, where, \"finding a ship sailing over unto Phoenicia,\" they \"went aboard, and set forth.\" At Tyre, where the ship was unloaded, they found a few disciples, with whom they were permitted to tarry seven days. Through the Holy Spirit these disciples were warned of the perils awaiting Paul at Jerusalem, and they urged him \"that he should not go up to Jerusalem.\" But the apostle allowed not the fear of affliction and imprisonment to turn him from his purpose.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 396}
