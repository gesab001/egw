{"word": "The angel, after his interview with Cornelius, went to Peter, in Joppa. At the time, Peter was praying upon the housetop of his lodging, and we read that he \"became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance.\" It was not for physical food alone that Peter hungered. As from the housetop he viewed the city of Joppa and the surrounding country he hungered for the salvation of his countrymen. He had an intense desire to point out to them from the Scriptures the prophecies relating to the sufferings and death of Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 135}
