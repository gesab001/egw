{"word": "In preaching the gospel in Corinth, the apostle followed a course different from that which had marked his labors at Athens. While in the latter place, he had sought to adapt his style to the character of his audience; he had met logic with logic, science with science, philosophy with philosophy. As he thought of the time thus spent, and realized that his teaching in Athens had been productive of but little fruit, he decided to follow another plan of labor in Corinth in his efforts to arrest the attention of the careless and the indifferent. He determined to avoid elaborate arguments and discussions, and \"not to know anything\" among the Corinthians \"save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.\" He would preach to them \"not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.\" 1 Corinthians 2:2, 4.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 244}
