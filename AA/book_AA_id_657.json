{"word": "Chap. 25 - The Thessalonian Letters\n\n     The arrival of Silas and Timothy from Macedonia, during Paul's sojourn in Corinth, had greatly cheered the apostle. They brought him \"good tidings\" of the \"faith and charity\" of those who had accepted the truth during the first visit of the gospel messengers to Thessalonica. Paul's heart went out in tender sympathy toward these believers, who, in the midst of trial and adversity, had remained true to God. He longed to visit them in person, but as this was not then possible, he wrote to them.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 255}
