{"word": "Tertullus here descended to barefaced falsehood; for the character of Felix was base and contemptible. It was said of him, that \"in the practice of all kinds of lust and cruelty, he exercised the power of a king with the temper of a slave.\" \n                                                                           420\n--Tacitus, History, ch. 5, par. 9. Those who heard Tertullus knew that his flattering words were untrue, but their desire to secure the condemnation of Paul was stronger than their love of truth.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 419}
