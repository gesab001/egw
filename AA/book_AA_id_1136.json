{"word": "All night the tempest raged, and notwithstanding the precautions that had been taken, the vessel leaked. \"The next day they lightened the ship.\" Night came again, but the wind did not abate. The storm-beaten ship, with its shattered mast and rent sails, was tossed hither and thither by the fury of the gale. Every moment it seemed that the groaning timbers must give way as the vessel reeled and quivered under the tempest's shock. The leak increased rapidly, and passengers and crew worked continually at the pumps. There was not a moment's rest for any on board. \"The third day,\" writes Luke, \"we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 442}
