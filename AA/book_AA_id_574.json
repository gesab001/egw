{"word": "With convincing power Paul reasoned from the Old Testament Scriptures that \"Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead.\" Had not Micah prophesied, \"They shall smite the Judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek\"? Micah 5:1. And had not the Promised One, through Isaiah, prophesied of Himself, \"I gave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting\"? Isaiah 50:6. Through the psalmist Christ had foretold the treatment that He should receive from men: \"I am . . . a reproach of men, and despised of the people. All they that see Me laugh Me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that He would deliver Him: let Him deliver Him, seeing He delighted in Him.\" \"I may tell all My bones: they look and stare upon Me. They part My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.\" \"I am become a stranger unto My brethren, and an alien unto My mother's children. For the zeal of Thine house hath eaten Me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached Thee are fallen upon Me.\" \"Reproach hath broken My heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.\" Psalm 22:6-8, 17, 18; 69:8, 9, 20.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 225}
