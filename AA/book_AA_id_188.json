{"word": "Christ said of Himself, \"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\" Matthew 10:34. The Prince of Peace, He was yet the cause of division. He who came to proclaim glad tidings and to create hope and joy in the hearts of the children of men, opened a controversy that burns deep and arouses intense passion in the human heart. And He warns His followers, \"In the world ye shall have tribulation.\" \"They shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for My name's sake.\" \"Ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.\" John 16:33; Luke 21:12, 16.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 84}
