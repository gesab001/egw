Instead, a note of triumph rings through the letters that he wrote from Rome to the churches. \"Rejoice in the Lord alway,\" he wrote to the Philippians, \"and again I say, Rejoice. . . . Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 484}
