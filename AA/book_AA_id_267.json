{"word": "Now Christ had spoken to Saul with His own voice, saying, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?\" And the question, \"Who art Thou, Lord?\" was answered by the same voice, \"I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.\" Christ here identifies Himself with His people. In persecuting the followers of Jesus, Saul had struck directly against the Lord of heaven. In falsely accusing and testifying against them, he had falsely accused and testified against the Saviour of the world.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 117}
