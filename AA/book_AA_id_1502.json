{"word": "The Saviour is presented before John under the symbols of \"the Lion of the tribe of Judah\" and of \"a Lamb as it had been slain.\" Revelation 5:5, 6. These symbols represent the union of omnipotent power and self-sacrificing love. The Lion of Judah, so terrible to the rejectors of His grace, will be the Lamb of God to the obedient and faithful. The pillar of fire that speaks terror and wrath to the transgressor of God's law is a token of light and mercy and deliverance to those who have kept His commandments. The arm strong to smite the rebellious will be strong to deliver the loyal. Everyone who is faithful will be saved. \"He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they \n                                                                           590\nshall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\" Matthew 24:31.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 589}
