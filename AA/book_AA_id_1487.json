{"word": "This revelation was given for the guidance and comfort of the church throughout the Christian dispensation. Yet religious teachers have declared that it is a sealed book and its secrets cannot be explained. Therefore many have turned from the prophetic record, refusing to devote time and study to its mysteries. But God does not wish His people to regard the book thus. It is \"the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him, to show unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass.\" \"Blessed is he that readeth,\" the Lord declares, \"and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\" Verses 1, 3. \"I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these \n                                                                           584\nthings, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the Holy City, and from the things which are written in this book. He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.\" Revelation 22:18-20.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 583}
