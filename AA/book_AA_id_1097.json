{"word": "Chap. 40 - Paul Appeals to Caesar\n\n     \"When Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem. Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, and desired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem.\" In making this request they purposed to waylay Paul along the road to Jerusalem and murder him. But Festus had a high sense of the responsibility of his position, and courteously declined to send for Paul. \"It is not the manner of the Romans,\" he declared, \"to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.\" He stated that \"he himself would depart shortly\" for Caesarea. \"Let them there . . . which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.\" \n                                                                           429", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 428}
