{"word": "John did not teach that salvation was to be earned by obedience; but that obedience was the fruit of faith and love. \"Ye know that He was manifested to take away our sins,\" he said, \"and in Him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him.\" 1 John 3:5, 6. If we abide in Christ, if the love of God dwells in the heart, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions, will be in harmony with the will of God. The sanctified heart is in harmony with the precepts of God's law.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 563}
