{"word": "John was a teacher of holiness, and in his letters to the church he laid down unerring rules for the conduct of Christians. \"Every man that hath this hope in him,\" he wrote, \"purifieth himself, even as He is pure.\" \"He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\" 1 John 3:3; 2:6. He taught that the Christian must be pure in heart and life. Never should he be satisfied with an empty profession. As God is holy in His sphere, so fallen man, through faith in Christ, is to be holy in his sphere.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 559}
