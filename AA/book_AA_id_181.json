{"word": "In the history of prophets and apostles, are many noble examples of loyalty to God. Christ's witnesses have endured imprisonment, torture, and death itself, rather than break God's commands. The record left by Peter and John is as heroic as any in the gospel dispensation. As they stood for the second time before the men who seemed bent on their destruction, no fear or hesitation could be discerned in their words or attitude. And when the high priest said, \"Did we not straitly command you that ye should not teach in \n                                                                           82\nthis name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man's blood upon us,\" Peter answered, \"We ought to obey God rather than men.\" It was an angel from heaven who delivered them from prison and bade them teach in the temple. In following his directions they were obeying the divine command, and this they must continue to do at whatever cost to themselves.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 81}
