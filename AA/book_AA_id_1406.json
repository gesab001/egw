{"word": "It is not the opposition of the world that most endangers the church of Christ. It is the evil cherished in the hearts of believers that works their most grievous disaster and most surely retards the progress of God's cause.

Their characters must be conformed to His character and their wills to His will. \n                                                                           550", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 549}
