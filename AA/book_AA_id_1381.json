{"word": "The confiding love and unselfish devotion manifested in the life and character of John present lessons of untold value \n                                                                           540\nto the Christian church. John did not naturally possess the loveliness of character that his later experience revealed. By nature he had serious defects. He was not only proud, self-assertive, and ambitious for honor, but impetuous, and resentful under injury.

But He revealed to him that for which his soul longed--the beauty of holiness, the transforming power of love.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 539}
