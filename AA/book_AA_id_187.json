{"word": "Shortly before His crucifixion Christ had bequeathed to His disciples a legacy of peace. \"Peace I leave with you,\" He said, \"My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\" John 14:27. This peace is not the peace that comes through conformity to the world. Christ never purchased peace by compromise with evil. The peace that Christ left His disciples is internal rather than external and was ever to remain with His witnesses through strife and contention.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 84}
