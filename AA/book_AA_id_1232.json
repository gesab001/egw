Of all the churches, that of Philippi had been the most liberal in supplying Paul's wants. \"Now ye Philippians know also,\" the apostle said in his letter, \"that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

Not because I desire a gift: but I desire \n                                                                           480\nfruit that may abound to your account. But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 479}
