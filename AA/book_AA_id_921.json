{"word": "To every minister the Lord declares: \"O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at My mouth, and warn them from Me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked \n                                                                           361\nfrom his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, . . . thou hast delivered thy soul.\" Ezekiel 33:7-9.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 360}
