{"word": "As God's work extends, calls for help will come more and more frequently. That these calls may be answered, Christians should heed the command, \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house.\" Malachi 3:10. If professing Christians would faithfully bring to God their tithes and offerings, His treasury would be full. There would then be no occasion to resort to fairs, lotteries, or parties of pleasure to secure funds for the support of the gospel.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 338}
