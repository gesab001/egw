{"word": "Chap. 34 - A Consecrated Ministry\n\n     In His life and lessons Christ has given a perfect exemplification of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God. God does not live for Himself. By creating the world, and by upholding all things, He is constantly ministering to others. \"He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\" Matthew 5:45. This ideal of ministry the Father committed to His Son. Jesus was given to stand at the head of humanity, by His example to teach what it means to minister. His whole life was under a law of service. He served all, ministered to all.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 359}
