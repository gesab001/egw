{"word": "The apostle Paul in his ministry among the churches was untiring in his efforts to inspire in the hearts of the new converts a desire to do large things for the cause of God. Often he exhorted them to the exercise of liberality. In speaking to the elders of Ephesus of his former labors among them, he said, \"I have showed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\" \"He which soweth sparingly,\" he wrote to the Corinthians, \"shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; \n                                                                           343\nnot grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\" Acts 20:35; 2 Corinthians 9:6, 7.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 342}
