{"word": "Chap. 11 - The Gospel in Samaria\n\n     After the death of Stephen there arose against the believers in Jerusalem a persecution so relentless that \"they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.\" Saul \"made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.\" Of his zeal in this cruel work he said at a later date: \"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison. . . . And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.\" That Stephen was not the only one who suffered death may be seen from Saul's own words, \"And when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.\" Acts 26:9-11. \n                                                                           104", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 103}
