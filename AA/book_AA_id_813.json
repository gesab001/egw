{"word": "The apostle adjured the Corinthians, \"Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.\" Should they become boastful and self-confident, neglecting to watch and pray, they would fall into grievous sin, calling down upon themselves the wrath of God. Yet Paul would not have them yield to despondency or discouragement. He gave them the assurance: \"God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 316}
