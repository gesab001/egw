{"word": "\"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\" The Holy Spirit, assuming the form of tongues of fire, rested upon those assembled.

The appearance of fire signified the fervent zeal with which the apostles would labor and the power  that would attend their work.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 39}
