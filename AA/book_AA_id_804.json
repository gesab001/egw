{"word": "\"If thy hand cause thee to stumble,\" the Saviour said, \"Cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell.\" Mark 9:43-45,\n                                                               313\nR.V.
