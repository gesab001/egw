{"word": "The apostle compared himself to a man running in a race, straining every nerve to win the prize. \"I therefore so run,\" he says, \"not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.\" That he might not run uncertainly or at random in the Christian race, Paul subjected himself to severe training. The words, \"I keep under my body,\" literally mean to beat back by severe discipline the desires, impulses, and passions.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 314}
