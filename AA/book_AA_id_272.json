{"word": "For three days Saul was \"without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.\" These days of soul agony were to him as years. Again and again he recalled, with anguish of spirit, the part he had taken in the martyrdom of Stephen. With horror he thought of his guilt in allowing himself to be controlled by the malice and prejudice of the priests and rulers, even when the face of Stephen had been lighted up with the radiance of heaven. In sadness and brokenness of spirit he recounted the many times he had closed his eyes and ears against the most striking evidences and had  relentlessly urged on the persecution of the believers in Jesus of Nazareth.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 118}
