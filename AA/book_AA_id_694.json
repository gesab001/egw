{"word": "Chap. 26 - Apollos at Corinth\n\n     After leaving Corinth, Paul's next scene of labor was Ephesus. He was on his way to Jerusalem to attend an approaching festival, and his stay at Ephesus was necessarily brief. He reasoned with the Jews in the synagogue, and so favorable was the impression made upon them that they entreated him to continue his labors among them. His plan to visit Jerusalem prevented him from tarrying then, but he promised to return to them, \"if God will.\" Aquila and Priscilla had accompanied him to Ephesus, and he left them there to carry on the work that he had begun.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 269}
