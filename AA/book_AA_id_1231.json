{"word": "Paul's letter to the Philippians, like the one to the Colossians, was written while he was a prisoner at Rome. The church at Philippi had sent gifts to Paul by the hand of Epaphroditus, whom Paul calls \"my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.\" While in Rome, Epaphroditus was sick, \"nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him,\" Paul wrote, \"and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.\" Hearing of the sickness of Epaphroditus, the believers at Philippi were filled with anxiety regarding him, and he decided to return to them. \"He longed after you all,\" Paul wrote, \"and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. . . . I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 479}
