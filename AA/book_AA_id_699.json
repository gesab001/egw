I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.\" 1 Corinthians 3:1, 2. Many of the Corinthian believers had been slow to learn the lessons that he was endeavoring to teach them. Their advancement in spiritual knowledge had not been proportionate to their privileges and opportunities.

Jealousy, evil surmising, and accusation had closed the hearts of many of the Corinthian believers against the full working of the Holy Spirit, which \"searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.\" 1 Corinthians 2:10. However wise they might be in worldly knowledge, they were but babes in the knowledge of Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 271}
