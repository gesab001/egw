The world is no more in harmony with the principles of Christ today than it was in the days of the apostles. The same hatred that prompted the cry, \"Crucify Him! crucify Him!\" the same hatred that led to the persecution of the disciples, still works in the children of disobedience. The same spirit which in the Dark Ages consigned men and women to prison, to exile, and to death, which conceived the exquisite torture of the Inquisition, which planned and executed the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and which kindled the fires of Smithfield, is still at work with malignant energy in unregenerate hearts. The history of truth has ever been the record of a struggle between right and wrong. The proclamation of the gospel has ever been carried forward in this world in the face of opposition, peril, loss, and suffering.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 84}
