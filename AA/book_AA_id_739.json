{"word": "Ephesus was a popular center for the worship of Diana. The fame of the magnificent temple of \"Diana of the Ephesians\" extended throughout all Asia and the world. Its surpassing splendor made it the pride, not only of the city, but of the nation. The idol within the temple was declared by tradition to have fallen from the sky. Upon it were inscribed symbolic characters, which were believed to possess great power. Books had been written by the Ephesians to explain the meaning and use of these symbols.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 286}
