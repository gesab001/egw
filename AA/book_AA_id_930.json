{"word": "The Saviour went from house to house, healing the sick, comforting the mourners, soothing the afflicted, speaking peace to the disconsolate. He took the little children in His arms and blessed them, and spoke words of hope and comfort to the weary mothers.

In His teaching there was an earnestness that sent His words home with convicting power.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 364}
