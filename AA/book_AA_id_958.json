In answer to the question, \"Have they stumbled that they should fall?\" the apostle replies: \"God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation \n                                                                           376\nis come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness? For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 375}
