There exist in these last days evils similar to those that threatened the prosperity of the early church; and the teachings of the apostle John on these points should be carefully heeded. \"You must have charity,\" is the cry heard everywhere, \n                                                                           555\nespecially from those who profess sanctification. But true charity is too pure to cover an unconfessed sin. While we are to love the souls for whom Christ died, we are to make no compromise with evil.

God requires His people in this age of the world to stand for the right as unflinchingly as did John in opposition to soul-destroying errors.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 554}
