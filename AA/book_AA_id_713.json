{"word": "Paul plainly set before the church the perils and the hardships that he and his associates had patiently endured in their service for Christ. \"Even unto this present hour,\" he declared, \"we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place; and labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day. I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you. For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.\" Verses 11-15.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 277}
