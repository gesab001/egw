And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was  Bar-Jesus: which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 167}
