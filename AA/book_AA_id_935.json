{"word": "It is not God's will that His ministers should seek to be rich. Regarding this, Paul wrote to Timothy: \"The love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, \n                                                                           367\nlove, patience, meekness.\" By example as well as by precept, the ambassador for Christ is to \"charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\" 1 Timothy 6:10, 11, 17-19.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 366}
