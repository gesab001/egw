{"word": "In his speech, Tertullus charged Paul with crimes which, if proved, would have resulted in his conviction for high treason against the government. \"We have found this man a pestilent fellow,\" declared the orator, \"and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: who also hath gone about to profane the temple.\" Tertullus then stated that Lysias, the commandant of the garrison at Jerusalem, had violently taken Paul from the Jews when they were about to judge him by their ecclesiastical law, and had thus forced them to bring the matter before Felix. These statements were made with the design of inducing the procurator to deliver Paul over to the Jewish court. All the charges were vehemently supported by the Jews present, who made no effort to conceal their hatred of the prisoner.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 420}
