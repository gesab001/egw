{"word": "It was on the Sabbath that the Lord of glory appeared to the exiled apostle. The Sabbath was as sacredly observed by John on Patmos as when he was preaching to the people in the towns and cities of Judea. He claimed as his own the precious promises that had been given regarding that day. \"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,\" John writes, \"and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, saying, \n                                                                           582\nI am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. . . . And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the seven candlesticks One like unto the Son of man.\" Revelation 1:10-13.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 581}
