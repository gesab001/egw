{"word": "This question was earnestly discussed, and was finally referred by the centurion to Paul, who had won the respect of both sailors and soldiers. The apostle unhesitatingly advised remaining where they were. \"I perceive,\" he said, \"that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.\" But \"the master and the owner of the ship,\" and the majority of passengers and crew, were unwilling to accept this counsel. Because the haven in which they had anchored \"was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the southwest and northwest.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 441}
