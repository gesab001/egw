{"word": "To the early church had been entrusted a constantly enlarging work--that of establishing centers of light and blessing wherever there were honest souls willing to give themselves to the service of Christ. The proclamation of the gospel was to be world-wide in its extent, and the messengers of the cross could not hope to fulfill their important mission unless they should remain united in the bonds of Christian unity, and thus reveal to the world that they were one with Christ in God. Had not their divine Leader prayed to the Father, \"Keep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me, that they may be one, as We are\"? And had He not declared of His disciples, \"The world hath hated them, because they are not of the world\"? Had He not pleaded with the Father that they might be \"made perfect in one,\" \"that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me\"? John 17:11, 14, 23, 21. Their spiritual life and power was dependent on a close connection with the One by whom they had been commissioned to preach the gospel.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 90}
