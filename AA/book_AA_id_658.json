{"word": "In this letter to the church at Thessalonica the apostle expresses his gratitude to God for the joyful news of their increase of faith. \"Brethren,\" he wrote, \"we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?\" \n                                                                           256", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 255}
