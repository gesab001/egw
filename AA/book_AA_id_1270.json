They had been present at many trials and had looked upon many a criminal, but never had they seen a man wear a look of such holy calmness as did the prisoner before them.

When he was permitted to speak in his own behalf, all listened with eager interest.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 494}
