{"word": "For forty days Christ remained on the earth, preparing the disciples for the work before them and explaining that which heretofore they had been unable to comprehend. He spoke of the prophecies concerning His advent, His rejection by the Jews, and His death, showing that every specification of these prophecies had been fulfilled. He told them that they were to regard this fulfillment of prophecy as an assurance of the power that would attend them in their future labors. \"Then opened He their understanding,\" we read, \"that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\" \n                                                                           27\nAnd He added, \"Ye are witnesses of these things.\" Luke 24:45-48.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 26}
