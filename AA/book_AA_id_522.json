{"word": "The apostle Paul felt a deep responsibility for those converted under his labors. Above all things, he longed that they should be faithful, \"that I may rejoice in the day of Christ,\" he said, \"that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.\" Philippians 2:16. He trembled for the result of his ministry. He felt that even his own salvation might be imperiled if he should fail of fulfilling his duty and the church should fail of co-operating with him in the work of saving souls. He knew that preaching alone would not suffice to educate the believers to hold forth the word of life. He knew that line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, they must be taught to advance in the work of Christ.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 206}
