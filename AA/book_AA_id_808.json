{"word": "Paul feared lest, having preached to others, he himself should be a castaway. He realized that if he did not carry out in his life the principles he believed and preached, his labors in behalf of others would avail him nothing. His conversation, his influence, his refusal to yield to self-gratification, must show that his religion was not a profession merely, but a daily, living connection with God. One goal he kept ever before him, and strove earnestly to reach--\"the righteousness which is of God by faith.\" Philippians 3:9.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 314}
