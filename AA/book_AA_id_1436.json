{"word": "Let those who feel inclined to make a high profession of holiness look into the mirror of God's law. As they see its far-reaching claims, and understand its work as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, they will not boast of sinlessness. \"If we,\" says John, not separating himself from his brethren, \"say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" \"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.\" \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" 1 John 1:8, 10, 9.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 562}
