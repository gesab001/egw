{"word": "Christ had finished the work that was given Him to do. He had gathered out those who were to continue His work among men. And He said: \"I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to Thee. Holy Father, keep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me, that they may be one, as We are.\" \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word; that they all may be one; . . . I in them and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.\" John 17:10, 11, 20-23.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 24}
