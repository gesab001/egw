{"word": "The Son of God stooped to uplift the fallen. For this He left the sinless worlds on high, the ninety and nine that loved Him, and came to this earth to be \"wounded for our transgressions\" and \"bruised for our iniquities.\" Isaiah 53:5. He was in all things made like unto His brethren. He became flesh, even as we are. He knew what it meant to be hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained by food and refreshed by sleep. He was a stranger and a sojourner on the earth--in the world, but not of the world; tempted and tried as men and women of today are tempted and tried, yet living a life free from sin. Tender, compassionate, sympathetic, ever considerate of others, He represented the character of God. \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, . . . full of grace and truth.\" John 1:14. \n                                                                           473", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 472}
