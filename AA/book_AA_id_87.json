{"word": "Under the training of Christ the disciples had been led to feel their need of the Spirit. Under the Spirit's teaching they received the final qualification, and went forth to their lifework. No longer were they ignorant and uncultured. No longer were they a collection of independent units or discordant, conflicting elements. No longer were their hopes set on worldly greatness. They were of \"one accord,\" \"of one heart and of one soul.\" Acts 2:46; 4:32. Christ filled their thoughts; the advancement of His kingdom was their aim. In mind and character they had become like their Master, and men \"took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.\" Acts 4:13.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 45}
