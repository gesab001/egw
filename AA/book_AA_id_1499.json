{"word": "It was through one who declared himself to be a \"brother, and companion in tribulation\" (Revelation 1:9), that Christ revealed to His church the things that they must suffer for His sake. Looking down through long centuries of darkness and superstition, the aged exile saw multitudes suffering martyrdom because of their love for the truth. But he saw also that He who sustained His early witnesses would not forsake His faithful followers during the centuries of persecution that they must pass through before the close of time. \"Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer,\" the Lord declared; \"behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation: . . . be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\" Revelation 2:10.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 588}
