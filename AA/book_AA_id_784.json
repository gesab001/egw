{"word": "The apostle made no mention of the false teachers who were seeking to destroy the fruit of his labor. Because of the darkness and division in the church, he wisely forbore to irritate them by such references, for fear of turning some entirely from the truth. He called attention to his own work among them as that of \"a wise master builder,\" who had laid the foundation upon which others had built. But he did not thereby exalt himself; for he declared, \"We are laborers together with God.\" He claimed no wisdom of his own, but acknowledged that divine power alone had enabled him to present the truth in a manner pleasing to God. United with Christ, the greatest of all teachers, Paul had been enabled to communicate lessons of divine wisdom, which met the necessities of all classes, and which were to apply at all times, in all places, and under all conditions.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 303}
