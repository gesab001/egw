{"word": "Those who would gain the blessing of sanctification must first learn the meaning of self-sacrifice. The cross of Christ is the central pillar on which hangs the \"far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\" \"If any man will come after Me,\" Christ says, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" 2 Corinthians 4:17; Matthew 16:24. It is the fragrance of our love for our fellow men that reveals our love for God. It is patience in service that brings rest to the soul. It is through humble, diligent, faithful toil that the welfare of Israel is promoted. God upholds and strengthens the one who is willing to follow in Christ's way.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 560}
