{"word": "In his letter to \"the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse,\" written while he was a prisoner in Rome, Paul makes mention of his joy over their steadfastness in the faith, tidings of which had been brought him by Epaphras, who, the apostle wrote, \"declared unto us your love in the Spirit. For this cause,\" he continued, \"we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 471}
