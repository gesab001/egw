{"word": "At the last meeting of Christ with His disciples by the sea, Peter, tested by the thrice-repeated question, \"Lovest thou Me?\" (John 21:15-17), had been restored to his place among the Twelve.

Now, converted and accepted, he was not only to seek to save those without the fold, but was to be a shepherd of the sheep.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 515}
