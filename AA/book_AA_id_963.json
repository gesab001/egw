{"word": "\"And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: for this is My covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

For God had concluded them all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon all.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 378}
