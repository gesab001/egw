{"word": "Notwithstanding the fact that Paul was personally taught by God, he had no strained ideas of individual responsibility. While looking to God for direct guidance, he was ever ready to recognize the authority vested in the body of believers united in church fellowship. He felt the need of counsel, and when matters of importance arose, he was glad to lay these before the church and to unite with his brethren in seeking God for wisdom to make right decisions. Even \"the spirits of the prophets,\" he declared, \"are subject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.\" 1 Corinthians 14:32, 33. With Peter, he taught that all united in church capacity should be \"subject one to another.\" 1 Peter 5:5.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 200}
