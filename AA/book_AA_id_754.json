{"word": "This gala season was a trying time for those who had newly come to the faith. The company of believers who met in the school of Tyrannus were an inharmonious note in the festive chorus, and ridicule, reproach, and insult were freely heaped upon them. Paul's labors had given the heathen worship a telling blow, in consequence of which there was a perceptible falling off in the attendance at the national festival and in the enthusiasm of the worshipers.

Many who had not openly accepted the new doctrines became so far enlightened as to lose all confidence in their heathen gods.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 292}
