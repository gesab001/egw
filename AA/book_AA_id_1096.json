{"word": "A ray of light from heaven had been permitted to shine upon Felix, when Paul reasoned with him concerning righteousness, temperance, and a judgment to come. That was his heaven-sent opportunity to see and to forsake his sins. But he said to the messenger of God, \"Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.\" He had slighted his last offer of mercy. Never was he to receive another call from God.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 427}
