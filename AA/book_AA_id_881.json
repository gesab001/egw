{"word": "When Paul sent Titus to Corinth to strengthen the believers there, he instructed him to build up that church in the grace of giving, and in a personal letter to the believers he also added his own appeal. \"As ye abound in everything,\" he pleaded, \"in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also,\" \"Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.\" \"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: . . . being enriched in everything to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.\" 2 Corinthians 8:7, 11, 12; 9:8-11.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 344}
