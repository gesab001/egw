{"word": "Chap. 10 - The First Christian Martyr\n\n     Stephen, the foremost of the seven deacons, was a man of deep piety and broad faith. Though a Jew by birth, he spoke the Greek language and was familiar with the customs and manners of the Greeks. He therefore found opportunity to preach the gospel in the synagogues of the Greek Jews. He was very active in the cause of Christ and boldly proclaimed his faith. Learned rabbis and doctors of the law engaged in public discussion with him, confidently expecting an easy victory. But \"they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.\" Not only did he speak in the power of the Holy Spirit, but it was plain that he was a student of the prophecies and learned in all matters of the law. He ably defended the truths that he advocated and utterly defeated his opponents. To him was the promise fulfilled, \"Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: for I will give \n                                                                           98\nyou a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.\" Luke 21:14, 15.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 97}
