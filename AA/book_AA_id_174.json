But all these things will they do unto you for My name's sake, because they know not Him that sent Me.\" \"They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.\" \"These things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.\" John 15:20, 21; 16:2, 4.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 79}
