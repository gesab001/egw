He knew from what motive they had flattered him, and he saw also that they had failed to substantiate their charges against Paul. Turning to the accused, he beckoned to him to answer for himself. Paul wasted no words in compliments, but simply stated that he could the more cheerfully defend himself before Felix, since the latter had been so long a procurator, and therefore had so good an understanding of the laws and customs of the Jews.

He declared that he had caused no disturbance in any part of Jerusalem, nor had he profaned the sanctuary. \"They neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,\" he said, \"neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 420}
