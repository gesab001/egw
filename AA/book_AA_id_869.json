{"word": "The spirit of liberality is the spirit of heaven. This spirit finds its highest manifestation in Christ's sacrifice on the cross. In our behalf the Father gave His only-begotten Son; and Christ, having given up all that He had, then gave Himself, that man might be saved. The cross of Calvary should appeal to the benevolence of every follower of the Saviour. The principle there illustrated is to give, give. \"He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\" 1 John 2:6.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 339}
