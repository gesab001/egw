{"word": "The work of the gospel minister is \"to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God.\" Ephesians 3:9. If one entering upon this work chooses the least self-sacrificing part, contenting himself with preaching, and leaving the work of personal ministry for someone else, his labors will not be acceptable to God. Souls for whom Christ died are perishing for want of well-directed, personal labor; and  he has mistaken his calling who, entering upon the ministry, is unwilling to do the personal work that the care of the flock demands.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 527}
