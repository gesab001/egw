{"word": "That this step was in the order of God, is revealed in the immediate results for good that were seen. \"The word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests \n                                                                           90\nwere obedient to the faith.\" This ingathering of souls was due both to the greater freedom secured by the apostles and to the zeal and power shown by the seven deacons. The fact that these brethren had been ordained for the special work of looking after the needs of the poor, did not exclude them from teaching the faith. On the contrary, they were fully qualified to instruct others in the truth, and they engaged in the work with great earnestness and success.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 89}
