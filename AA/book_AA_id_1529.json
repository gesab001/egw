Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee.\" Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched His servant's mouth, saying, \"Behold, I have put My words in thy mouth.\" Jeremiah 1:7-9. And He bids us go forth to speak the words He gives us, feeling His holy touch upon our lips.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 599}
