{"word": "The apostle bade the Galatian believers consider carefully their first experience in the Christian life. \"O foolish Galatians,\" he exclaimed, \"who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 384}
