{"word": "Of the special sense in which this love should be manifested by believers, the apostle writes: \"A new commandment \n                                                                           549\nI write unto you, which thing is true in Him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.\" \"This is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.\" \"He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because He laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 548}
