{"word": "That this church did not escape persecution is shown by an expression in Paul's letter to them. He says, \"Unto you \n                                                                           219\nit is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake; having the same conflict which ye saw in me.\" Yet such was their steadfastness in the faith that he declares, \"I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now.\" Philippians 1:29, 30, 3-5.", "paragraph": 4, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 218}
