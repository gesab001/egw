{"word": "Apollos was desirous of going on into Achaia, and the brethren at Ephesus \"wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him\" as a teacher in full harmony with the church of Christ. He went to Corinth, where, in public labor and from house to house, \"he mightily convinced the Jews, . . . showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.\" Paul had planted the seed of truth; Apollos now watered it. The success that attended Apollos in preaching the gospel led some of the believers to exalt his labors above those of Paul. This comparison of man with man brought into the church a party spirit that threatened to hinder greatly the progress of the gospel.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 270}
