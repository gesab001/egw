In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.\" John 14:1-4. For your sake I came into the world; for you I have been working. \n                                                                           22\nWhen I go away I shall still work earnestly for you. I came to the world to reveal Myself to you, that you might believe. I go to My Father and yours to co-operate with Him in your behalf.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 21}
