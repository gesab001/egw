{"word": "Impressions alone are not a safe guide to duty. The enemy often persuades men to believe that it is God who is guiding them, when in reality they are following only human impulse. But if we watch carefully, and take counsel with our brethren, we shall be given an understanding of the Lord's will; for the promise is, \"The meek will He guide in judgment: and the meek will He teach His way.\" Psalm 25:9.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 279}
