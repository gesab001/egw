{"word": "Charity \"doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.\" Christ-like love places the most favorable construction on the motives and acts of others. It does not needlessly expose their faults; it does not listen eagerly to unfavorable reports, but seeks rather to bring to mind the good qualities of others.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 319}
