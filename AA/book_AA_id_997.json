{"word": "In one of the open windows sat a youth named Eutychus. In this perilous position he went to sleep and fell to the court below. At once all was alarm and confusion. The youth was taken up dead, and many gathered about him with cries and mourning. But Paul, passing through the frightened company, embraced him and offered up an earnest prayer that God would restore the dead to life. His petition was granted. Above the sound of mourning and lamentation the apostle's voice was heard, saying, \"Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.\" With rejoicing the believers again assembled in the upper chamber. They  partook of the Communion, and then Paul \"talked a long while, even till break of day.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 391}
