{"word": "The principle for which the disciples stood so fearlessly when, in answer to the command not to speak any more in the name of Jesus, they declared, \"Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye,\" is the same that the adherents of the gospel struggled to maintain in the days of the Reformation. When in 1529 the German princes assembled at the Diet of Spires, there was presented the emperor's decree restricting religious liberty, and prohibiting all further dissemination of the reformed doctrines. It seemed that the hope of the world was about to be crushed out. Would the princes accept the decree? Should the light of the gospel be shut out from the multitudes still in darkness? Mighty issues for the world were at stake. Those who had accepted the reformed faith met together, and their unanimous decision was, \"Let us reject this decree. In matters of conscience the majority has no power.\"--Merle d'Aubigne, History of the Reformation, b. 13, ch. 5.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 68}
