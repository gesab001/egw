{"word": "Chap. 31 - The Message Heeded\n\n     From Ephesus Paul set forth on another missionary tour, during which he hoped to visit once more the scenes of his former labors in Europe. Tarrying for a time at Troas, \"to preach Christ's gospel,\" he found some who were ready to listen to his message. \"A door was opened unto me of the Lord,\" he afterward declared of his labors in this place. But successful as were his efforts at Troas, he could not remain there long. \"The care of all the churches,\" and particularly of the church at Corinth, rested heavily on his heart. He had hoped to meet Titus at Troas and to learn from him how the words of counsel and reproof sent to the Corinthian brethren had been received, but in this he was disappointed. \"I had no rest in my spirit,\" he wrote concerning this experience, \"because I found not Titus my brother.\" He therefore left Troas and crossed over to Macedonia, where, at Philippi he met Timothy. \n                                                                           324", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 323}
