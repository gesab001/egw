{"word": "Peter kept alive in his heart the hope of Christ's return, and he assured the church of the certain fulfillment of the Saviour's promise, \"If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself.\" John 14:3. To the tried and faithful ones the coming might seem long delayed, but the apostle assured them: \"The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 536}
