The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who has drunk most deeply of His spirit of self-sacrificing love,--love that \"vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, . . . seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil\" (1 Corinthians 13:4, 5),--love that moves the disciple, as it moved our Lord, to give all, to live and labor and sacrifice even unto death, for the saving of humanity.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 543}
