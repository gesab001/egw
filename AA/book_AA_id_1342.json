{"word": "The lesson applies to believers in every age. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" Matthew 7:20. The inward adorning of a meek and quiet spirit is priceless. In the life of the true Christian the outward adorning is always in harmony with the inward peace and holiness. \"If any man will come after Me,\" Christ said, \"let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" Matthew 16:24. Self-denial and sacrifice will mark the Christian's life. Evidence that the taste is converted will be seen in the dress of all who walk in the path cast up for the ransomed of the Lord.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 523}
