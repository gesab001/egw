{"word": "These principles are dwelt upon at length in Paul's first letter to the Corinthian church. The apostle refers to \"the ministers of Christ\" as \"stewards of the mysteries of God,\" and of their work he declares: \"It is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. For I know nothing by myself; yet I am not hereby justified: but He that judgeth me is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.\" 1 Corinthians 4:1-5.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 276}
