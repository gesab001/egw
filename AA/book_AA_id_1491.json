{"word": "It was Christ who bade the apostle record that which was to be opened before him. \"What thou seest, write in a book,\" He commanded, \"and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.\" \"I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore. . . . Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.\" Revelation 1:11, 18-20.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 585}
