{"word": "The apostle's desire for those to whom he addressed his letters of counsel and admonition was that they should \"be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine;\" but that they should all come into \"the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\" He entreated those who were followers of Jesus in heathen communities not to walk \"as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God . . . because of the blindness of their heart,\" but \"circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time.\" Ephesians 4:14, 13, 17, 18; 5:15, 16. He encouraged the believers to look forward to the time when Christ, who \"loved the church, and gave Himself for it,\" would \"present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing\"--a church \"holy and without blemish.\" Ephesians 5:25, 27.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 470}
