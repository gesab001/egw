The veil that had prevented them from seeing to the end of that which had been abolished, was now removed, and they comprehended with perfect clearness the object of Christ's mission and the nature of His kingdom.

The traditions and superstitions inculcated by the priests were swept away from their minds, and the teachings of the Saviour were accepted.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 44}
