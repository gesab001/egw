His chief object in making this visit, as he himself declared afterward, was \"to see Peter.\" Galatians 1:18. Upon arriving in the city where he had once been well known as \"Saul the persecutor,\" \"he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he \n                                                                           129\nwas a disciple.\" It was difficult for them to believe that so bigoted a Pharisee, and one who had done so much to destroy the church, could  become a sincere follower of Jesus. \"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 128}
