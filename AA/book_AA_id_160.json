And she said, Yea, for so much. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.

And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.\"", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 73}
