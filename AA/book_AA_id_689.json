{"word": "Especially solemn is the apostle's statement regarding those who should refuse to receive \"the love of the truth.\" \"For this cause,\" he declared of all who should deliberately reject the messages of truth, \"God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\" Men cannot with impunity reject the warnings that God in mercy sends them. From those who persist in turning from these warnings, God withdraws His Spirit, leaving them to the deceptions that they love.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 266}
