{"word": "Jeremiah also bore witness of the coming Redeemer as a Prince of the house of David: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is His name whereby He shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness.\" And again: \"Thus saith the Lord: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.\" Jeremiah 23:5, 6; 33:17, 18.", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 223}
