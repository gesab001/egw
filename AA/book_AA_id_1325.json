{"word": "In the later years of his ministry, Peter was inspired to write to the believers \"scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.\" His letters were the means of reviving the courage and strengthening the faith of those who were enduring trial and affliction, and of renewing to good works those who through manifold temptations were in danger of losing their hold upon God. These letters bear the impress of having been written by one in whom the sufferings of Christ and also His consolation had been made to abound; one whose entire being had been transformed by grace, and whose hope of eternal life was sure and steadfast.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 517}
