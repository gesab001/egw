{"word": "Paul was inclined to remain at Jerusalem, where he could face the opposition. To him it seemed an act of cowardice to flee, if by remaining he might be able to convince some of the obstinate Jews of the truth of the gospel message, even if to remain should cost him his life. And so he answered, \"Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on Thee: and when the blood of Thy martyr Stephen was shed, I was also standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.\" But it was not in harmony with the purpose of God that His servant should needlessly expose his life; and the heavenly messenger replied, \"Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.\" Acts 22:19-21.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 130}
