{"word": "Until his latest hour the life of Paul testified to the truth of his words to the Corinthians: \"God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.\" 2 Corinthians 4:6-10. His sufficiency was not in himself, but in the presence and agency of the divine Spirit that filled his soul and brought every thought into subjection to the will of Christ. The prophet declares, \"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee: because he trusteth in Thee.\" Isaiah 26:3. The heaven-born peace expressed on Paul's countenance won many a soul to the gospel.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 510}
