{"word": "\"The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.\" Psalm 34:7. God commissions His angels to save His chosen ones from calamity, to guard them from \"the pestilence that walketh in darkness\" and \"the destruction that wasteth at noonday.\" Psalm 91:6. Again and again have angels talked with men as a man speaketh with a friend, and led them to places of security. Again and again have the encouraging words of angels renewed the drooping spirits of the faithful and, carrying their minds above the things of earth, caused them to behold by faith the white robes, the crowns, the palm branches of victory, which overcomers will receive when they surround the great white throne.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 153}
