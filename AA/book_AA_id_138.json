{"word": "Of the disciples after the transfiguration of Christ it is written that at the close of that wonderful scene \"they saw no man, save Jesus only.\" Matthew 17:8. \"Jesus only\"-- in these words is contained the secret of the life and power that marked the history of the early church. When the disciples first heard the words of Christ, they felt their need of Him. They sought, they found, they followed Him. They were with Him in the temple, at the table, on the mountainside, in the field. They were as pupils with a teacher, daily receiving from Him lessons of eternal truth. \n                                                                           65", "paragraph": 3, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 64}
