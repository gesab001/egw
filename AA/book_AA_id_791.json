{"word": "In this letter to the Corinthians Paul endeavored to show them Christ's power to keep them from evil. He knew that if they would comply with the conditions laid down, they would be strong in the strength of the Mighty One. As a means of helping them to break away from the thralldom of sin and to perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord, Paul urged upon them the claims of Him to whom they had dedicated their lives at the time of their conversion. \"Ye are Christ's,\" he declared. \"Ye are not your own. . . . Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 306}
