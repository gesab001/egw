{"word": "Paul's writings show that the gospel minister should be an example of the truths that he teaches, \"giving no offense in anything, that the ministry be not blamed.\" Of his own work he has left us a picture in his letter to the Corinthian believers: \"In all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; by pureness, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich.\" 2 Corinthians 6:3, 4-10.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 369}
