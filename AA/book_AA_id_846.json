{"word": "\"We have this treasure,\" the apostle continued, \"in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.\" God could have proclaimed His truth through sinless angels, but this is not His plan. He chooses human beings, men compassed with infirmity, as instruments in the working out of His designs. The priceless treasure is placed in earthen vessels. Through men His blessings are to be conveyed to the world. Through them His glory is to shine forth into the darkness of sin. In loving ministry they are to meet the sinful and the needy, and lead them to the cross. And in all their work they are to ascribe glory, honor, and praise to Him who is above all and over all.", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 330}
