{"word": "Richly favored was this beloved disciple. He had seen his Master in Gethsemane, His face marked with the blood drops of agony, His \"visage . . . marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men.\" Isaiah 52:14. He had seen Him in the hands of the Roman soldiers, clothed with an old purple robe and crowned with thorns. He had seen Him hanging on the cross of Calvary, the object of cruel mockery and abuse. Now John is once more permitted to behold his Lord. But how changed is His appearance! He is no longer a Man of Sorrows, despised and humiliated by men. He is clothed in a garment of heavenly brightness. \"His head and His hairs\" are \"white like wool, as white as snow; and His eyes . . . as a flame of fire; and His feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace.\" Revelation 1:14, 15. His voice is like the music of many waters. His countenance shines as the sun. In His hand are seven stars, and out of His mouth issues a sharp two-edged sword, an emblem of the power of His word. Patmos is made resplendent with the glory of the risen Lord.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 582}
