He repeats Isaiah's declaration concerning God's people: \"Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: for He will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma and been made like unto Gomorrah.\"", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 379}
