{"word": "Chap. 3 - The Great Commission\n\n     After the death of Christ the disciples were well-nigh overcome by discouragement. Their Master had been rejected, condemned, and crucified. The priests and rulers had declared scornfully, \"He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.\" Matthew 27:42. The sun of the disciples' hope had set, and night settled down upon their hearts. Often they repeated the words, \"We trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel.\" Luke 24:21. Lonely and sick at heart, they remembered His words, \"If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?\" Luke 23:31.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 25}
