{"word": "\"And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.\" \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" The conditions of obtaining mercy from God are simple and reasonable. The Lord does not require us to do some grievous thing in order to gain forgiveness. We need not make long and wearisome pilgrimages, or perform painful penances, to commend our souls to the God of heaven or to expiate our transgression. He that \"confesseth and forsaketh\" his sin \"shall have mercy.\" Proverbs 28:13.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 552}
