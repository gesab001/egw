{"word": "The lessons of Christ, setting forth meekness and humility and love as essential to growth in grace and a fitness for His work, were of the highest value to John. He treasured every lesson and constantly sought to bring his life into harmony with the divine pattern. John had begun to discern the glory of Christ--not the worldly pomp and power for which he had been taught to hope, but \"the glory as of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\" John 1:14.", "paragraph": 1, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 544}
