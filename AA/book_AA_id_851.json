Fixing his gaze on the reward of the faithful, he exclaimed in tones of victory, \"Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.\"", "paragraph": 2, "bookcode": "AA", "page": 332}
